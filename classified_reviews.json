But in this new era of restaurants thinking they can make up wage increases by implementing a service charge the metropolitan grill has won the prize for over compensating. To my surprise when the bill came there was a 20% service charge. Because the service charge wasn't even going to the servers, it was for the company's profit to pay their employees above average benifits and supposedly year end bonus. This will be the last time i dine here."

        "Other": "My only gripe is that I do wish there was less confusion regarding the 20% service charge many establishments in the area have put in place to offset an increased minimum wage. Does any of that charge go to the service staff beyond their base compensation- or should I be forking out an additional percentage? It puts a sour note on the tail end of an otherwise lovely evening when you're sitting with a bill wondering whether declining to pay 30 to 40% over your bill is effectively stiffing someone who just spent an hour and a half waiting on your needs. This isn't a burden diners should have to bear. I wish area restaurants would just raise their menu prices. I don't know why, but it feels like less of a conundrum that way."

Maybe should consider creating a more \"formal\" and \"informal\" dining area and sit people accordingly.
