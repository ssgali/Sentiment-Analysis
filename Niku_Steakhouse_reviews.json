After that we had the tomahawk, it was really tender and juicy (you can easily share it among 3 - 4 people). Drinks are also \ud83d\udc4c. To finish we had the lemon chiboust dessert as recommended by our waitress but we were not sure about the combination between cilantro and ice cream. Great experience in general.",

Everything from the appetizers, the main courses and the desserts were all rock solid. I expected at least one of these categories to be a little weak (as they are with most restaurants) and I was continually pleasantly surprised by the dynamic flavors and incredibly well-prepared, and well-seasoned food overall.\n\nMy only critique would be that the broccolini was undercooked for my taste and a little too heavy on the garlic, and the porterhouse rolls were slightly disappointing \u2014 they were made of some kind of wheat dough with an added aromatic that wasn\u2019t needed in my opinion. I was hoping for the classic buttery white bread porterhouse rolls! But if you are looking for exotic flavors, and open to things being a little different than expected, there\u2019s no shortage of that at Niku.\n\nThe ambience was modern, tasteful and chic. The music was a little loud, but that helped to provide a very immersive experience. After a few drinks you don\u2019t notice as much lol.\n\nThey have three different seating options: bar, tables, and chefs counter. This was not as clearly explained as it could\u2019ve been on their website or on OpenTable. The pictures I found online didn\u2019t give a clear enough idea of what the different seating options would look like, so that made planning a special occasion a little difficult.\n\nOtherwise, I couldn\u2019t recommend this place enough.",

The space is designed with an eye for detail that elevates the dining experience. The atmosphere was vibrant; the restaurant was bustling, yet it felt intimate at the Chef's Counter. \n\nDining Experience: Sitting at the Chef's Counter was a highlight. Watching the chefs work their magic was not only entertaining but also educational. The menu was inventive, and the flavors were bold yet harmonious. Each course was explained with care, adding depth to the meal.\n\nOverall: Niku is a great find in The City, offering a lively and luxurious dining environment. It's the kind of place you want to return to, and I definitely plan to go back. Whether for business or pleasure, Niku delivers an unforgettable dining experience. Highly recommended for those looking for exceptional Japanese cuisine in a dynamic setting.",

The texture and flavor was not even close to the wagyu I ate in Japan. The sides were had were very good (oysters, ravioli, potatoes, bone marrow and rice). My husband\u2019s trout was outstanding. Overall it\u2019s a nice one-time experience if you are willing to pay over $400 per person not including drinks or dessert.",

Niku starters never disappoint with the oysters being ridiculous this time around as well as the pasta. As always the Wagyu tasting was superb with the A5 reigning supreme.

My favorite was the potato crisp plate, and the tomahawk steak, and the wagyu meatball, and the charred broccolini (basically everything we had lol). We will be back again!",

I had a martini that wasn't cold enough. kinda set me on a course of wondering if the meal was going to live up to expectations, but tried to stay positive.\n\nI was seated at the chef's counter, which was a fun experience. \n\ntwo major issues:\n\nwhile the food was good overall, nothing I ate blew me away. the scallop dish was presented awkwardly on a half of a lime, kinda struck me as amateurish in appearance and the flavors didn't pop. tartare was very rich and decadent and the quality of the steak was excellent, but it was underseasoned.  the puffed rice accoutrement had gone a little soggy in storage. tsukune was good but wasn't anything to write home about. I had the a4 wagyu as my main. it was cooked nicely, but again, was underseasoned and perhaps it's nitpicking, but I wasn't crazy about the appearance of one of the two pieces. \n\nthe other major issue was service. it seemed like no one was paying attention to me after I placed my order. I was lucky that I was able to flag down someone working at the pass repeatedly for various things, including a glass of wine that I had hoped to have when my steak arrived. I decided to eat most of it before that happened because I didn't want it to get cold while I waited. unfortunately, things like that happened a few times and along with issues with the food, I felt like things weren't up to the standards of a restaurant with the accolades it has received. \n\nunfortunately, I don't think I could strongly recommend niku to others, which is too bad because I  love japanese steakhouses and had high hopes.",

To our beginner Wagyu palate, the A4 was our favorite. But before getting to that, the starters were alone worthy of their Michelin star.

I noticed that when other parties order sides, everything came out all at once when their steak was ready. When our tasting menu was delivered it came with the crab rice. I thought surely the crispy potatoes would come soon after. We waited maybe 20-30mins before we follow up. The potatoes came 5 mins later. They comped this item since it came late.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say the food was really good! The a5 9oz tasting was the perfect amount for my fiance and I. The a5 was soo rich that just a small amount was more than enough.\n\nWe are definitely coming back. We wanna try the rib and the tomahawk next!",

The layers of potato were still great but the meat wasn\u2019t as tender and marvelous as I\u2019d remembered.\n\nI used Inkind to pay which turned into a nightmare of an ordeal. I entered the table number instead of the check number and by chance ended up paying a bill that was within $10 of ours. I got called after leaving the restaurant to try to fix the error. Although I offered to just pay the difference on the bill (which seemed the easiest way to resolve the problem and not take up too much of anyone\u2019s time), they insisted on completely reversing out the bill (ie, the payment of the bill via Inkind plus the payment via credit card for the tip on the subpar service we received) and charging everything anew. I said with no uncertainty to our server that if I ended up with double the charge because the first didn\u2019t actually end up reversing that I would be extremely upset and he swore to me up and down that it wouldn\u2019t be the case, that the manager took care of it.\n\nFast forward a week later when the charges are still there (both of them) and I contact Inkind directly to resolve the issue. They tell me that it (what the manager did) wouldn\u2019t have worked because I don\u2019t have a specific house account with that restaurant. Whoopee. So, I eventually got my first charge reversed, but not by the restaurant, who seemed to have no problem keeping me waiting for an extra 15-20 minutes while they \u201chandled\u201d the problem. This totally unsavory, non-customer friendly interaction, in addition to the so-so culinary experience, kills any desire I might have to visit this place again. Food wasn\u2019t worth the price and the service was far from even being amiable.",

Realistically the only disappointment is just how expensive things are, but this is true of San Francisco in general. Either way, dining at Niku is always fulfilling and I certainly enjoy sitting at the chef's counter. Being able to interact with the chef and ask questions is worth the visit alone. The food here honestly comes second to that level of access for me. \n\nThe food itself was delicious and on this visit I decided to skip the traditional steaks and had the short rib. I slightly regret this decision as the short rib, while it tasted great, was super rich and did not give me that satiated feeling I was looking for. I would still order it again in the future. Fortunately the other dishes I ordered helped me reach that fulfillment I was seeking.\n\nThe best part about dining at Niku is the service. Every single person working in this restaurant is welcoming, warm, and very personable. They were all very easy to talk to and did not come off as pretentious like in some other high end restaurants. The people and the service they provided are why I came back and will continue to come back.\n\nThere is a caveat however to eating at the Chef's counter. It's very tight sitting there and you are definitely having dinner with the other guests sitting beside you. If you are ok with literally sitting shoulder to shoulder with strangers then you will enjoy this experience. However, if you want a more intimate setting then skip the counter.",

We shared potatoes and the asparagus both were amazing. Ended with lemon something dessert also amazing and a French press. We sat at the chefs table which I highly recommend!!

Came for my father's birthday and it did not disappoint. From the moment we arrived, they wished my father a HBD, then promptly seated us in the perfect spot. Our main waiter was delightful and made the best recommendations from wine to how much to order. From the amuse bouche to the complimentary passion fruit cream puffs at the end, as each of the wait staff came with our next dish, they presented beautifully prepared, artfully arranged dishes-all tasty.\nWe ordered the gorgeous gem salads, soft shell crab, asparagus, crispy potato cubes, NY steaks,\nrib eye, parker house rolls and finished with refreshing sorbets.\nMy heartfelt thanks to the incredible staff who work tirelessly and seamlessly to make the experience so fantastic. They were accommodating, attentive and thoughtful with their beautifully handwritten birthday note, the perfect menu and adding a candle to my father\u2019s dessert making for a very special evening. If you're planning a special dinner or are just in the mood for a great steakhouse and drinks this is it!",

My husband was waving his hand every time someone kinda glanced our way but to no avail. We had a waiter but he was off tending to many things. I'd say it's due to poor management. If you're a well run restaurant you have someone (usually a manager) who makes sure the diners are all being taken care of and we saw no such thing. The front of the bar seating area was doted on but we sat on the side area and were abandoned. Don't get seated there, anywhere else would have been stellar service from start to finish!",

The fermented tomato and shishito topped busters were also amazing. Nothing tops the steaks. We didn\u2019t tasting of the a3, a4 and a5 wagyus, the 48 oz tomahawk which they do Pittsburgh style and the 44 farms ribeye. All were outstandingly cooked and. Some of the.best steaks we have ever eaten. The amuse bouches served by the chef were also good. Papaya cream puffs and an avocado cream toasts.

We thought there was going to be more than one plate but that was it. We also ordered the beef tartare and that was refreshing! First time having airy fried tendon! Very unique! The bone marrow was okay, a bit too much sauce for me. My friend asked for more sliced bread but our waiter declined. The overall service was okay, could be better. We also ordered the tomahawk which is more worth it than the Japanese A5 tasting. Wagyu brownie and the fruity tart was a great way to end the meal! I would go here again for the unique appetizers and desserts. For Japanese A5 wagyu, I would go to Yazawa or Yakiya (great quality/quantity for a decent price, also better service).",

Everything we tried was good, but i highly recommend the potatoes if its your first time. Steaks are excellent here. I would recommend getting the tomahawk, medium rare or rare. I ordered medium and it was a bit dry for my taste at medium heat. If you have a good apetite tasting menu needs to be supplemented with some starters. The restaurant has clean facilities. Bar does a good with cocktails and has a good selection of wines, but no beers on tap.",

The steak was honestly the best steak I\u2019ve ever had! It was nice and crispy on the outside and soft and flavorful inside! It\u2019s a Michelin star restaurant which I didn\u2019t know when we booked. I wish I had dressed up a little bit more. I felt a little underdressed with my skirt and sweater.

Unfortunately our 9:15 reservation was not honored on time, understandably because the party before us sat longer than planned.  But the 6 of us were packed into a sliver of a standing waiting area for 30 minutes before the decision was taken to offer us an upgrade to the private room, as it was not booked and the other table didn\u2019t get up.  What was strange about this was that for 30 minutes waiting, we weren\u2019t even offered a drink while we waited, and the private room could\u2019ve been offered considerably earlier, as it was empty.\n\nOnce we were seated at 9:45, we had a truly wonderful time.  Our server Chris was exceptional, as were the other staff members.  We were brought some complementary items, and clearly there was a big effort to provide us a wonderful experience.  THE FOOD was incredibly delicious and my cocktail was interesting and light as air.  The steaks were out if this world, and will certainly be calling us back.  The sides were also wonderful, as was the salad.  The desserts didn\u2019t blow us away as much as the rest of the meal, but the toasted rice ice cream and brownie stood stronger than the rest.  Overall our experience was exceptional, with the exception of our wait time and experience.  We will definitely come again and loved so much about it.",

I don't eat meat and I'm usually fine with a starter and side.  But almost nothing here is meat free--the pasta starter had \"veal jus\", almost everything else (even the caviar) had some kind of meat broth, drippings, or garnishes, even the potatoes had meat drippings, and  THE BROWNIE AND ICE CREAM are made with Waygu fat.  No ceasar salad, no fries or meat free potatoes, no creamed spinach, etc.  However, if everyone in your party loves meat you're good.  And the service is excellent, and good drinks and Parker House rolls.  Avoid tables in which the waiters keep smacking the back of your chair, it's an unfortunate distraction in a nice restaurant like this.",

It's the only steakhouse on the list in the world which says a lot.\n\nWe arrived and it is dark at the front. I almost missed it. I could finally see inside when I got to the front. No big signage. As you enter you see the hug wall of liquor and all high end. I loved it. Nice and long and lots of booze. Really classy.\n\nWe were greeted and I told them our name. We were seated right away. It was back away from the wood fire pit. This is where the magic happens. You could see the owner/chef working his magic.\n\nWe ordered the matsutake soup, brassica cappelletti and the bone marrow to start off. The soup had great flavor and the cappelletti was yummy. The bone marrow was so good and liked the bread with it.\n\nNext was the 44 farms prime ribeye and a5 Miyazaki. both were cooked perfectly. The wagyu was just like in Japan. You never find the real deal in the states. We got the crispy potatoes and it was amazing and perfect to go with our steaks. I should of got some rice hahah.\n\nIt was neat that they bring over a tray of different knives from you to pick from to use on your steaks. They are mostly made from Italy and I picked the cleaver. It was really sharp.\n\nWe got the ginger lemon custard which was good but strong ginger taste. Then the olive oil cake which my wife really enjoyed.\n\nThe food was amazing and you could tell that they were deserving of the Michelin Star.",

Loved the experience.\n\nMe and my partner sat at the chef\u2019s counter for the full experience, and it did not disappoint.\nI have to start off by saying that the music was impeccable - I\u2019m a pretty big hip hop fan, and the songs I heard, I was NOT expecting on a steakhouse aux. Big ups to whoever was on aux - you just solidified us coming back.\n\nFrom the bartender to the servers and chef, service was outstanding. Ian was patient, helpful, and communicable. The chef in particular gave us tips on how to dine in a Michelin-star restaurant, which is fantastic, as I was just under the impression that pre-bussing the table was \u2018out of consideration.\u2019 But as the chef has taught us, intention may be trumped by impact, and that was the lesson of the night. Great service, I couldn\u2019t say it enough.\n\nThe wagyu tomahawk was huge and delicious. Good amount of fat, the crust was perfect, my partner said it was the most flavorful tomahawk we\u2019ve had, and we\u2019ve had quite a few around the bay, in hawaii, NY. Steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, and we enjoyed every bite at the chef counter, and later when we got home for a late night snack.\n\nIf you\u2019re in your steak era, you have to come to Niku steakhouse, you just have to. Thank you, Niku! We\u2019ll be back!",

We had at least 5 different people apologize for the wait and thank us for our patience, but I think offering a drink or two or a dessert on the house would have gone a long way to show this isn't typical business.

From the very first bite, it was clear: the food transcends ordinary delight, charting its own territory in extraordinary flavor. Among the steaks I've savored over the years, the one at Niku easily contends for the top spot.\n\nOur meal commenced with two distinct appetizers: a creatively crafted eggplant dish and a fresh, vibrant salad. Both set high expectations for what was to follow. The main event, a 6oz. A5 steak, was exceptional, its rich flavors and melt-in-your-mouth texture affirming its premium quality. Accompanying sides of perfectly roasted potatoes and crisp shishito peppers complemented the steak beautifully.\n\nHowever, our experience was blemished by an unusually long wait for our main course. Despite the restaurant's evident bustle, a two-hour wait in a fine dining setting felt disproportionate, even misplaced. Patience was tested, though the staff's politeness was constant.\n\nRedemption came in the form of dessert--a brownie so divine, it bordered on celestial. It dissolved any lingering frustration, leaving behind a sweet aftertaste and fond memories.\n\nWould I return? For the food, a resounding yes.\n\nYet, a note on expectations: when an evening's fare ventures into the realm of $600 plus tip, one anticipates service that mirrors the excellence of the cuisine. While the culinary journey at Niku was largely unparalleled, there remains room for improvement in harmonizing the service with the establishment's high calibre. The symphony of a perfect dining experience requires both elements in concert.",

They clean your table between each portion and give you new plates.\n\nDevil in the details: The host came back to our table with a tableside purse hanger as they noticed the lady brought her purse and hung it on the chair. They pour all the drinks for you tableside. Smaller things like I hadn't put the cloth over my legs yet and they carefully draped it over for me; they even folded the cloth over while my parter went to the restroom ad they noticed it was crumpled to the side. You definitely feel pampered/monitored in a good way.\n\nPatient. We closed out the restaurant clocked in a 3 hour dinner. Even then, they made sure we could still enjoy our dessert and wrap up our conversation without any real looks of rush.\n\nCONS:\n\nThe steaks came out a bit cold. We didn't realize why it wasn't as soft as it should be until after thinking about why it wasn't (mostly speaking of the Tomahawk). For what you pay for and it being a steakhouse, the internal temperature is obviously important but the serving temperature is just as crucial...not sure if the steak sat there a bit before it came to our table but we were expecting soft warm  bites.\n\nPrice can be steep for what you get and especially may feel even steeper when things feel off with your food but fortunately our experience with the steak wasn't too off. I think you have to come with the mindset of not only food but ambience and service included in the pricing.",

I\u2019ve been to some nicer restaurants with a cork fee but I have never seen this happen before. Big turn off. Steak was perfect sides and apps were flawless but when your spending around 1500 for a dinner I would figure they would let us open our own bottle of wine.

The maitake mushroom side was also an unforgettable experience.  We ordered the pickles too, and they served as a pleasant palate cleanser.  The pickled cucumber skin was a standout, however.  We had lots of starters, including the little gems salad, the steak tartare, the bone marrow, and the corn tortelloni.  All were delicious, but the steak mains were the undisputed stars. The only complaint about the tartare is it was very garlicky and blew out our palates for the next course\u2014the tortellini\u2014a bit. Morsels of beef in the bone marrow overwhelmed the delicate marrow flavor a bit.  All of the cocktails were very well done.  For dessert, we had the sweet pea mousse and the \u201cmeadow\u201d herbal tea infusion.  The strawberry sorbet on the side of the mousse was packed with fresh strawberry flavor.  My only wish is that the chlorophyll freshness of sweet pea were stronger in the mousse. White chocolate overwhelmed the pea taste a bit.  The infusion was a beautiful and calming finish to the meal.  Overall, this was a fantastic experience. The staff was attentive and friendly.  I would gladly come here again.",

Great salad, my husband said best he's ever had; son loved the bone marrow and his steak; don't miss the potatoes.  And having them offer you a choice of knives is fun.

To sit in front of the chefs and watch them at their craft is by far as enjoyable as the steak. The cuts of steak were amazingly marbled and truly melted in your mouth. Cooked perfectly, asked for a medium and the chef re assured me of the quality and that medium rare is the true choice\u2026 he wasn\u2019t wrong. The service although classy, still down to earth to make me feel comfortable. As I watched the chef prepare an order of the beef rib I was surprised to see that they made it in a similar way to mine. I saw him throwing away the thin pieces of fat, I quickly haunted him and said \u201cif you\u2019re just going to throw it away\u2026 is it possible\nI could try it?\u201d He cut me up a slice of the fat from the beef rib \u2026 now I have to come back for this specific cut!!!!!!\n\nFavorite steak house don\u2019t hesitate to go!!!",

        "Content": "I had been looking forward to coming to Niku for months, and when the day came, it did not disappoint. the restaurant was slightly smaller than anticipated, but by no means was it 'small' or 'cramped'. The ambiance was great, definitely felt high-end, but still had a casual air to the whole place. Our server, Eric, was absolutely amazing and extremely helpful when navigating the menu. Each and every dish was explained masterfully and led to a nice learning aspect to the whole dinner. When asking about the mains, not only did he explain the dishes, but proceeded to bring the raw cuts out to show us the difference in size and marbling. I cannot explain how happy we all were with the service and overall energy of the restaurant.\n\nStarting dinner off, we ordered the crispy pig ears, bone marrow, and beef tartare as appetizers. All of them were phenomenal, but I personally have to give my favorite to the pig ears. Upon eating them, I was brought back to my childhood with the flavor profile. I was really looking forward to the bone marrow and tartare, but after tasting the pig ears, I was hooked (not to say I didn't indulge in the other dishes). When ordering the mains, I personally was able to try the tomahawk, filet, ribeye and NY strip. All were cooked great, but I would say the NY strip and filet really stood out. We ordered the rolls, asparagus, and mushroom as sides, and all three complemented the dinner perfectly. Each and every drink at dinner was great too, and I loved being able to try some rare whiskey as well. Each and everything at dinner added to this experience.\n\nLastly, I want to touch on why we all wanted to come to Niku in the first place: the Wagyu. We ordered the tasting platter and upgraded to the plate with the A5 Kobe. To keep it short, it did not disappoint. If you've never had wagyu, you got to give this a try! Everything was a great experience, and I can't wait to do it again.",

We ordered the pig ears (OMG - so delicious) and the roasted bone marrow to start.  Both very decadent - if I only could pick one - it's the pig ears.  Braised - sweet and salty deliciousness.  Don't shy away from trying this dish - so good.  The roasted bone marrow is topped with mushrooms - very earthy, very hearty, delicious dish.\n\nOur son ordered the wagyu tasty- pricey at $440 for 9oz of meat -but spring break and he has good grades!  He was in heaven - tender, and delicious.  He could tell the difference between the cuts - and really appreciated Japanese wagyu is nothing like American beef.  My husband and I shared the ribeye - more than enough for two.  We overindulged on sides - parker house rolls (for my husband- buckwheat never tasted so light and fluffy), the crispy potatoes (magical really),the pickled vegetables (necessary to cut through all the fat),and the roasted mushrooms (very earthy - probably could have done without).  We were stuffed but had to try the wagyu fat brownie - heavenly (again- don't shy away from trying this!).  Service was attentive and friendly, space was beautiful and comfortable.  View of the grill from the dining room was entertaining.  Highly recommend this as a special occasion experience - your wallet and waistline couldn't handle more than an occasional visit!",

I did the A5 tasting, and I've done these in Japan, and can say that the meat wasn't grilled to perfection, which was a disappointment. The tartare was perfect, and so was the mushroom side, but the steaks were average in my opinion when it comes to preparation (uneven medium rare with some rare chunks that don't render the fat). I also wasn't a fan of the service, I was seated and waited nearly 20 minute before a waiter discussed the menu with me, and was sporadically attended throughout. The wagyu fat brownie dessert was fantastic. I'd say I would return but not for the steak.",

NY was probably the best I\u2019ve ever had, the Satsumi was so rich and melted in your mouth and the Takamori was on a whole mother level.

It was very smooth and rich! the meat was incredibly fresh ! The bone marrow was really good but there is not a lot in the bone, I still highly recommend it if you like bone marrow ! I even sucked on the bone ! For our main entree we got the tomahawk, potatoes and the rice. I am very proud of my partner and myself because we finished that whole steak and it is big! Definitely a good stake to share ! the potatoes were soo good and crispy but soft in the middle ! The rice was very rich and flavorful !  For dessert we did coffee and the toffee cake it was really good ! All the flavors just complimented each other in every dish...Also forgot to mention their drinks are soo amazing as well I recommend any of their cocktails. \n\nThe ambiance at this restaurant is definitely  top tier. The staff makes sure the table is clean and clear at all times, they are all very nice and attentive to  the guests ! I would highly recommend this Niku to others for a date night or a celebration they are worth it !",

It\u2019s like rubber . The chef should try their steak first before serve . Safeway grocery have better meat quality than this steakhouse . Ate two small pieces with difficulty and I gave up  . had to take it home and cook it again , asked for medium rare and got a rare and it\u2019s cold . Is definitely overpriced and overrated for the quality of the meat . I\u2019m Not coming back here and not recommending this \u201csteakhouse\u201d to people I know .

I am very familiar with the product offerings of Masami Cattle Ranch, Washugyu, Imperial, and El Rancho.\n\nI was very excited to try the restaurant for the first time. We were seated at the counter, right in front of the action where the steaks were being grilled.\n\nBoth my guest and myself ordered the filet mignon and requested it rare, knowing that it is quite common for steaks to come out slightly more done than requested.\n\nWhen we received the steaks, they were way overcooked for rare, were DRY, and mediocre at best. $105 each fillet and sadly no better than a $25 steak at a diner. Cold, Dry, and Sad cuts of meat.\n\nAlso the chefs who were working the grill conversed with groups to our left and to our right, but we did not receive any warm welcome from them. This experience made a bad steak worse.\n\nThe saving grace here was the tartare, bone marrow, crispy potatoes, and wagyu fat brownies.\n\nBut no one goes to a GREAT steakhouse merely for the appetizers and dessert.\n\nI will give this place another chance for one of their ribeyes, but unlike baseball it will be 2 strikes for an out.",

For the amount of money I really wish the owner were more accommodating. He specifically said To not move me although there were multiple open tables in a dif seating area. It was disappointing and frankly rude, as I witnessed the conversation happening behind the bar between hostess and owner. It effected how much I wanted to even be there and how much I wanted to spend as I was ready and excited to go all in, but w the lack of accommodation it felt like I was just one more customer that did not mean much to them. It was delicious food and I did tip well as the bartenders and servers don\u2019t deserve to be penalized for bad management. But it made me feel icky and sad AND COLD while spending $300. Not ideal.

I feel the price is more for the service and single source import from a Japanese farm. We got the off menu item $440 for 9oz total, 3 types of A5, shared between two people. It's a little over seasoned, texture is 4/5. Service is 3/5, there were many waiters walking around but they are not super attentive. There were 3 times that I wanted service and waited for more than a few minutes. For the price point I was expecting Michelin level service because the bill came out as a 3 star Michelin restaurant but after 2.5 hours of dining I was disappointed. We have waited for more than an hour to get the first taste of the dishes. \n\nI like the sides and appetizers more than the main course. I would give the small dishes 4.5/5, nice flavors with a reasonable price. I am still interested in other types of Janapense Wagu they serve so that my review is not biased. Since the most expensive ones are not that impressive, but it's good enough for me to return to try other items on the menu.",

The cod was like a fish had died, gone to fish heaven and came back down as an angel on our plate. So silky and buttery in texture and flavor. We had a side of rice that was better than I expected.

However, there was an issue where the server didn't correctly take our order as we didn't get one of our main entrees. We've ordered the a5 tasting menu to go along with the new york strip. The server actually brought out the different cuts to show us the different sizes which led to us changing our mind from ordering the ribeye midcap to the strip. \n\nUnfortunately, our server did not catch our order and we were left with only the tasting menu for the night which left us quite hungry. It was a late reservation, so as we started to see the chefs packing things up, we knew something was wrong. When our server came around to check on us, it was way too late to remedy the issue. We were offered desserts or coffee in exchange, but at that point, we were just hungry so that offer was not something that we were interested in. We ended our night finding a late night pizza place for a slice. Definitely not how I expected the night to end when taking someone from out of town to SF fine dining. \n\nNormally, I don't think we would mind such a mistake, but for a restaurant of this calibre and missing out on one of the main entree (1 or 2) for what the restaurant is known for, is a bit disappointing.",

I wish I had reserved seats earlier because I reserved a little too late and didn\u2019t get to experience sitting in the main dining area. I was at a high top next to the bar so the ambiance wasn\u2019t the greatest especially since I was at the table closest to the entrance.

We liked this seat as it was right next to some clear glass windows that gave us a peek into their butchery next door and it felt like one of the more private seatings in the restaurant. The food was excellent as expected: we ordered the steak tartare, bone marrow, a5 sampler, and the wagyu filet mignon. The a5 sampler came with 2 cuts of wagyu, 4oz of each. The wagyu filet mignon was 8oz and my favorite of all the cuts since it was on the leaner side. We also had a side of the Parker rolls which we inhaled since they were so good even without the actual butter it came with. For dessert we had the black sesame ice cream and coffee for 2 which was the perfect way to end our meal.",

We spent nearly $1k on dinner and were very disappointed with who we assumed to be the management team in suits. We were rushed to pay our bill and made to feel less than welcome and very judged since we were casually dressed for a 5 pm reservation and our boys were also casually attired.  Everything was great other than the presence of these managers who clearly judged us to be not good enough for their restaurant. It\u2019s too bad since the food and other service was great but not sure I can support management like this. Note, we also decided to go to this restaurant because our son learned about it through a school assignment about minority owned businesses including this one and dumpling time.

Dinner was excellent, service was a bit lacking this time. I was handed a wine menu that was empty twice, we had more services from Rachel the som last time when we brought our own bottle of wine vs. this night. As we finished up dinner, we also noticed there was still wine left in our bottle... overall food was great, service could have been improved and different experience than the last two times. I hope this feedback helps.",

I appreciated his input and recommendations. The atmosphere was beautiful, dark and modern with clean lines. The bar looked really beautiful and we sat at the chefs bar top so had line of sight to the cooking which was cool. Food options were all great and complimented the steaks really well. Did get a bit loud and packed about an hour or two into opening but glad they\u2019re business is doing well. Overall a great experience and glad I got to celebrate a special occasion here.",

The music was played so loudly that I couldn't hear the person I was with speaking. BUT the service was excellent and top notch. The servers are super kind there.
