This is not the Metropolitan quality of food and service that they are known for and unfortunately this was the second visit where we experienced this slow service and mediocre food.

        "Content": "The Metropolitan Grill knows steak and pairs top notch beef with classic steakhouse atmosphere and simply perfect appetizers, starters & sides.  We stared off with and appetizer that Anthony Bourdain inspired us to try and now never pass up when available: roasted bone marrow on crostini with hazelnut romesco sauce and brilliantly accented with pickled shallots. My wife had the house field green salad; nicely balanced flavors, and I had the sublime Maine Lobster Bisque and fought to restrain myself from simply drinking from the soup tureen. My wife had the most amazing steak dinner of her life: a small but intensely delicious 4 oz Japanese A5 Snow Beef Filet.  I enjoyed a chef's menu choice 14 oz bourbon aged striploin.  Both medium rare (of course!) and served in complement with simply perfect starch sides for us - the mashed potatoes & the baked potato with all the classic toppings.  We had never done a flambeed tableside desert, and seeing the description of the Hot Apple Pie we knew this was the place to try it.  Needless to say we were not disappointed.  Both the performance and the resulting desert for two were fantastic.  No matter what else you may choose for the rest of your meal, we highly suggest ending with the Hot Apple Pie!\n\nThe staff was polite and attentive from reservation check in & coat check at the host station all through out the meal courses and flambeed tableside desert, paying the bill and coat check out.  It was relatively early on a Saturday before a performance at the Paramount and the general manager also stopped by to ask how our meal was.  \n\nMy wife and I look forward to dining at The Metropolitan Grill again.  Our 26th wedding anniversary is in June.  You can be sure I'll be marking my calendar in May to get a reservation as soon as they're available.",

The appetizers and soups were excellent.  The steaks were perfect; just beware the degree of \"doneness\" was less that typical at most restaurants.  Those of our party who did not order beef enjoyed excellent seafood entrees.  The desserts were no exception; in particular, the carrot cake was \"best in class!\"",

The decor was out dated with small old dark green velvet covered booths and  very dem lighting. We understand this may be the atmosphere they are trying to present but it could be much nicer at the rate they charge. \nThe food was good but not exceptional . Your automatically charge $25 gratuity fee than have the gall to add \u201cif you are feeling generous you can add a tip that will go to the waitress/waiter\u201d which is just frustrating. We are happy to tip accordingly to the service we receive but the built in gratuity fee on top plus the cost a person pays for a meal in our opinion is not worth the expense.",

Always had a great meal and service until this last visit. We ordered two medium rare Chateaubriand's for the five of us at $180 per piece. I was shocked when they came out as medium well. The ma\u00eetre de knew very well when he started carving the meat that they were not cooked to order yet he kept on carving rather than send it back to the kitchen and ordered two new ones. To offer us dessert on the house to make up for their kitchen's mistake is insulting and not a very good way to compensate for a bad meal. We did not come for the dessert, we came because of it's reputation as top steak house. I called in the next day to the restaurant to talk to management and received a call back the next day. Although the manager was congenial enough and listened to my feedback, his solution to compensate me was to throw out a few free appetizers for the next time in. After this experience, there will not be a next time. In all honesty, the two cuts of meat should have been compted. I have no problem paying for the cocktails, wine and appetizers that we enjoyed with our food but do not feel it fair that we ended up with two tasteless and very expensive cuts of meat. An establishment like this should know way better.",

Their food has always been excellent.  The steaks are always cooked at a perfect temperature and the flavors are always spot on.   \nBut in this new era of restaurants thinking they can make up wage increases by implementing a service charge the metropolitan grill has won the prize for over compensating.  To my surprise when the bill came and Aaron explained to me that there was a 20% service charge I just about lost it.  Because the service charge wasn't even going to Aaron and Scott, it was for the company's profit to pay their employees above average benifits and supposedly year end bonus.  And if we wanted to tip our server they would receive all of it, well good for MG to be so generous.  This will be the last time i dine here and i will be reposting this review on every site i can, so that futre patrons are aware of this ridiculous 20% robbery.",

There was a mix up with our sides originally, but the staff corrected the error in under five minutes. And the restaurant treated us to a complimentary dessert to share for the occasion. My only gripe is that I do wish there was less confusion regarding the 20% service charge many establishments in the Seattle area (including this one) have put in place to offset an increased minimum wage. Does any of that charge go to the service staff beyond their base compensation- or should I be forking out an additional percentage? It puts a sour note on the tail end of an otherwise lovely evening when you\u2019re sitting with a bill wondering whether declining to pay 30 to 40% over your bill is effectively stiffing someone who just spent an hour and a half waiting on your needs. This isn\u2019t a burden diners should have to bear. I wish area restaurants would just raise their menu prices. I don\u2019t know why, but it feels like less of a conundrum that way.",

The Drinks are good though!\n\nOur server wasn't very good at pacing and we came in at 7:15 and didn't leave until 9:40pm. The food took a very long time. The initial table greet, drink order, app + dinner order took too long. Table check up was very lack luster. Our server also never introduced himself. Overall the guest connection wasn't there and the food was meh. I would suggest going to Ruth Chris's over the Met since they at least have more server attentiveness and the food is better. If you want the best steaks in town, then I would suggest Bateau.",

Metropolitan definitely serves it in their food and their spectacular service. The service was consistently warm and welcoming throughout their restaurant. We ordered a 40 oz bone in rib eye, and it was cooked very nicely just the way we asked for it, which was between medium and medium rare, if you get what I mean. We also got to watch it cut right in front of us by a very skillful staff member. Portions are great for the price you are paying and everything about this place is just wonderful. Should I also mention the incredible famous people who have also dined here at this steakhouse? I would most definitely visit this steakhouse again next time I am in town and I reckon you give them a try if you haven\u2019t yet already.",

        "Content": "We have eaten at MG five or six times over the past decade and have always found it to be one of Seattle's premier steakhouse's. Unfortunately this time didn't compare to our past visits.  Our table was cramped for a party of 4 and I feel we should have been seated in a booth. Our server was on par; however, the sommelier didn't appear to really know the wine list and had a very hard time making recommendations. For the 3rd time in my life I sent my meal back. The prime rib was tough and cold in addition to the potatoes. Two others in our party had the Wagu and American filets which were lukewarm and not very flavorful. The other meal consisted of the bone-in rib steak which was hot and very good. Our server did see to it that we were comp'd for the prime rib which was a solid thing to do. Bottom line: If I'm going to spend in excess of $500 for a meal I expect it to be nothing short of spectacular. This trip to MG resulted in me feeling as though I paid prime prices for a sub-par meal. It's doubtful we will be back.",

My daughter has eaten many steaks at many steakhouses, and understands the type of meat she is getting when ordering a steak, and what cooked medium means. The steak she ordered was very rare, and stringy. We took her steak home & I finished cooking it properly. My daughter finished some of it, & the rest we threw out.",

Our waiter could have cared less that it was a very special occasion for our family and did nothing to try and make it special. He judged us from the very beginning, and although we spent over $400, he treated us like trash. He added the 20% gratuity with no notice so walked away with a $75 tip for being rude and condescending the whole time. Although the restaurant holds special family memories from the past and the ambiance is beautiful, the food was simply average and the prices and service were terrible. I will never go back.

All food was delivered by someone other than my waiter. Also I received my meal but then had to ask for wine to go with it even though I expressed desire for wine with the meal earlier in the evening. I had already started eating before I was able to request it. I believe that the service is now driven by other factors. First I was asked how often I come there. Which isn't that often so perhaps my not being a regular mattered. Second, my party wasn't big enough or drink enough to make it worth their while to put in the time. It definitely was not worth the money. Very disappointed since it wasn't like it has been in the past. Guess I will start looking for another favorite restaurant in Seattle.",

It's like someone confused pepper with the salt.  Even after scraping the crust and the top of the Steak, it was still incredibly salty.  I didn't want to send it back because that's just bad karma..however I feel the need to reach out-for the price of the steak, this instance was pretty unfortunate.  My GF's filet and the meatball appetizers were awesome and of the usual quality The Met tends to achieve-so I'm just guessing I got the short end of the stick on this particular night.  Bummer! No need for this much salt, it was like someone just poured over the steak and lost track or time",

The entire evening went on without them even mentioning a congratulations or doing anything at all. We got our family with us to celebrate and had a let down from the restaurant. There also has to be more clarity ahead of time on letting clients know all parties are being charged a 20% service fee, Tell us ahead of time so we know, and if you\u2019re confirming you have something set for us your clients to celebrate- actually do it and not just leaves wondering what happened and leave dissatisfied and disappointed.

Additionally, according to the manager I spoke with, the servers are now being paid commission (I\u2019m ok with that) at a rate of 13%.  When the server brought us the check she pointed out the new service charge  but omitted the fact that she was on commission.  So, in fact, with a 20% tip and 13% commission she would have made banked a pretty robust tip.  I\u2019m all for tipping according to service received. But there\u2019s some smoke and mirrors here that most people are not throwing a fit over. I did, and got the service charge removed. My meal was ~really~ $250 (see attached receipt.)  The 20% \u201cservice charge\u201d ($50) + a 20% tip on the entirety of the check ($65) would have totaled $105 on $250 check. This is a BAD practice and I will not return. There lots of upscale steak houses in Seattle. Oh...and that Woodford Double Oak for $14?  A 1 oz pour. Simple highway robbery.",

The server, however, had to \"scoot\" between the back of my chair and the back of the chair of one of their party. She chose to use my chair as leverage to squeeze between multiple times. A portable table was set up next to our table effectively narrowing the aisle so that servers were squeezing between it and our table.

We each had a bowl of soup (clam chowder for him and French onion for me!), then shared the Chateaubriand, and the apple \"pie\" for dessert. Everything was amazing, about the experience from the time we arrived (about 30 minutes prior to our 7:30pm reservation, but they were able to accommodate immediate seating) until the time we walked out the door. I highly suggest ordering anything prepared tableside, as you'll get to have a great conversation as your food is being prepared. Our server, Lance, was prompt and professional and the combined team created an exceptional experience. \n\nWhile I gave The Met 4 stars for \"Value\", you don't really go there for a \"value\" meal - you go there for the experience that only fine dining gives you.",

We were a party of 5 and ordered 5 different steaks,  I tasted them all and they were all excellent,45 day rib-eye, Waygu-Angus NY, NY and Filet, no complaints on the steaks or their preparation. The same can't be said for the sides. The garlic mashed potatoes were super dry and cakey, I don't recall them being like this in the past. Also the cauliflower side was mediocre, the preparation with almonds and feta is promising but the execution was off, the florets could have been better caramelized to add to the complexity of the dish. It also seemed like something was missing to bring it all together. The Brussels sprouts were also disappointing, again the preparation held promise but the execution lacked. I recall some roasted caramelized sprouts that i had a scout restaurant several years ago. They were simply amazing, like vegetable candy, so i know the lowly Brussels sprout can achieve greatness. That is what i would expect from a restaurant of the Met's caliber. The met prepares truly memorable steaks but the need to up their game on the sides. Also it is a bit noisy for my taste, call it energetic if you will but it makes conversation difficult.",

We felt we had had slightly better marbled and flavorful aged, prime steaks from our butcher, and wished, since this is not a cheap evening, that perhaps we had gone for an even more expensive cut, but it was still above average. Sommelier gave us excellent advice on a great Italian wine form the lengthy, wine list, well within our preferred price range. Desert was shared: a well-made flourless, chocolate concoction.

Only 5 of us were able to actually attend - one had a last-minute cancellation - so, we ended up being 5 people at a banquet round for 10.  We spent the two hours there, not able to hear what anyone else at the table was saying (that was just the accoustics, nothing to do with the baby which screamed next to our table for 3/4 of our time at the Met - that was just unlucky).  The food was quite good.  The service was good until the entrees arrived, at which point our server, and all other staff, forgot we existed.

Our waiter, Bruno, who was outstanding,  suggested the almond-crusted scallops as an appetizer. The scallops were the best we've ever tasted, and the chateaubriand, carved tableside, was memorable. The sides were just OK. The ambiance was friendly and fairly elegant, and the noise level, though not whisper-quiet, was fine for normal conversation. I had two glasses of The Devil You Don't Know syrah (also Bruno's suggestion) and my wife had one. We shared the Hot Apple Pie for dessert. We hadn't paid close attention to the prices, so we were a little surprised that the $250 didn't quite cover the meal and gratuity, but we'll definitely return for a special meal in the near future.",

The steak salad was delicious, with a generous portion of perfectly cooked steak sliced up on top of fresh, tasty greens and tangy blue cheese. The kind of salad that you crave a few days afterwards and want to go back and eat it again. Daily special was beef stroganoff, a tasty and ample serving of tender meat and creamy sauce with the depth of flavor coming from mushrooms and onions. Delicious comfort food. The service here is absolutely top-notch. It's an easy spot to love and return to. Thank you for a great mean and a great experience.",

The person serving us, Marla, was someone we had in the past for a Christmas gathering with our children. And it was like being served by a good friend you've known for a long while. Everyone from the person seating us, to the wine sommelier, to all the other people stopping by the table just to pour some more wine or to remove an empty appetizer plate, or to \"dress\" a baked potato were there when needed, and not when not needed.

The service was perfect - our server was intuitive to our needs without being intrusive to our meal. The food itself was amazing; we had the crab cakes and artichoke hearts and both were delicious. For our main course we ordered the chateaubriand which is prepared tableside and that was incredible to watch. It was the most perfectly cooked filet I've ever had - absolutely worth the price in my opinion. The sides were ok - nothing special (mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts). We ordered cr\u00e8me brulee for dessert and it was very good, again not anything overly special but it was very good and we ate it all. Their wine list is extremely impressive - we enjoyed a nice Syrah and a Cab blend - both were by the glass and were VERY good. I was surprised by how loud the restaurant was - when we arrived and were seated there were maybe 3 other tables occupied in the section, however, by the end of our meal every table to was full and it was very loud. We could have conversation in our booth but I can't imagine being seated at a center table - that was the ONLY downside to the entire evening but because it wasn't really crowded until towards the end of our meal I can't really count that as a negative for our visit. If you are wanting a more intimate/quiet experience, come earlier than 7pm. We loved the experience overall and we will definitely be back for a special occasion.",

The feel and decor for the restaurant are classic and classy. Gives you a good feeling to the place. Service from the staff as a whole wasn\u2019t horrible but wasn\u2019t on par from other steakhouses. Food was average and wine was over priced and not very well advised on.\nWe were greeted checked in pleasantly, however my wife felt she was getting stares from certain staff members when she pushed by our 2 year old in her stroller. The person who took us to our booth seamed a bit unfriendly but didn\u2019t upset our mood. Our waiter was nice and did take our drink order almost right away. My lobster bisque was average with no lobster bits or chunks like others I have had, my wife\u2019s French onion was great however. I ordered the \u201csnow beef\u201d because I have had all other cuts of beef on the menu at other places, my wife the SRF filet. I felt my steak was ok, not impressive but nothing bad. The filet was as expected from SRF, delicious. We wanted a bottle of wine and asked for an opinion from their solminer but didn\u2019t suggest or give us a better recommendation. The wine had little to no character. We also didn\u2019t get checked on or asked about our meal or liking of our meat. Rather strange for and steakhouse. \nGiven it\u2019s price I wanted to love the food especially if it would have met my expectations.

Last time, my husband\u2019s steak was extremely rare and they cooked it longer but it ended up being excessively charred on the surface. Not sure if I\u2019ll continue to go eat there. It\u2019s a little disappointing. But like I said, the experience is wonderful.",

There was so much, I ate my leftovers for two additional meals. Even my husband, who has a big appetite, brought enough home for breakfast the next day.

We waited a long time before we got water served.   I received the wrong salad order but the waiter graciously corrected the error and comped us the salad.  The main course was not cooked the way I requested. I asked for medium and it came out rare.    There was no salt on the table or pepper. \n This place does not have the quality lunches that  I remember.   I remember getting bread and butter served which did not happen this time.    Our experience was not good, but my lunch dates were ok with their food.",

The food did not disappoint but the service was horrible! To be honest general service was great as always but the waiter serving us was horrible! \nWe ordered a dish and he said that was not available, no apologies or anything. We ordered a second dish and he said he was going to check of that was still available but never returned with the answer. \nWhen we finally ordered, he was not very polite when responding to our questions about the side.\nLastly, at the end of our meal, I asked for a box to take home the leftover sides I had (no meat was left). He used a very rude tone and asked \u201care you taking this???\u201d. That was very inappropriate and impolite of him to ask. \nI am still a big fan of their food and all the service has always great, but this waiter was a total disappointment!",

        "Content": "Your restaurant is such a classic place and maybe I'm old fashioned but the way some of the people dress is so disappointing.  We like dressing up whenever we go there because we usually go to celebrate special occasions.  Birthdays, anniversaries, etc.  but then we look across and we see people dressed in jeans, old t-shirt, and sneakers and we just wonder why it would be too difficult for someone to come in with even just khakis and nice shirt and anything other than sneakers.\n\nThis might sound bad but maybe Metropolitan should consider creating a more \"formal\" and \"informal\" dining area and sit people accordingly.  That way people who don't like to dress up can sit comfortably with others that feel the same way.  Also people who like to dress up a little more than others can also enjoy an evening of \"fine\" dining.  I realize that you would never turn money away cause that's not a good business but creating atmospheres for different types of people might be worth trying out.",

Lots of dark colors; i.e. dark tables, etc.  The first booth I sat in had a seat cushion that was loose and whenever you sat down the cushion would slide towards the center of the table and I would slide with it.  I am a heavy set older gentleman and it was quite embarassing to feel like everyone was staring at me while I kept sliding off the seating bench under the table.  \nI immediately asked the waiter for a new table with chairs and he promptly obliged me.  From there on out it was smooth sailing.  I had the aged filet mignon and it was so tender......it was like cutting through butter.  One of the best cuts of meat I have had in a very long time!\nThe waiter was also wonderful; you felt like he had been there for ever as his knowledge and confidence made you feel like you were in great hands.",

We had a cocktail in the bar area before moving to our table. No table linens, silverware and wine glasses had water spots on them. After having scallops , soup and salad they brought our entrees out. We both ordered the fillet sampler medium rare and they were both undercooked. The server removed the steaks and left our hot garnish to get cold.no visit from a head waiter floor manager. I would say the MG did not meet our expectations and did not even compare to our favorite steakhouse in California ( Donovan\u2019s ) we also have better meals at the chain restaurants like Ruth Chris\u2019s and Morton\u2019s.

Brought the rest home. Steaks came with a large baked potato, yum. Half was boxed. We shared perfectly cooked asparagus. I highly recommend their White Chocolate Yellow Cake. Another item that was boxed after enjoying some there. Our Server was such a delight! She totally embraced our celebratory spirit and took care of every service need.

The entire restaurant will look your way when they light it, so if your looking to show your lady a special night or she put a little effort into her look for the night, do her the favor of getting her a little extra attention by ordering this! Our service was phenomenal!",

We were seated promptly in a high sided corner booth which allowed for a bit of privacy and good conversation. This would be an ideal seat for a romantic date or anniversary. We weren't able to imbibe as we were still on the clock, but the virgin bloody mary was tasty and spicy. My co-worker and I both ordered the Monday special of London Broil, which is a bargain at $16. Unfortunately, my slice was very stringy and tough, which was surprising given the outstanding steaks I have had in the past at the Met. We were pressed for time to get back to work so I didn't send it back. The service was very good, we let the server know we were pressed for time and he did a terrific job of timing our meal and wrapping us up quickly. We did get dessert to go and that evening my husband, daughter and I each enjoyed a generous slice of carrot cake from the single serving that I took home!  I am a big fan of The Met and won't let this one fluke change that opinion.",

The service is impeccable from the moment you pull up to the curb...Valet parking, coat check, hostess, wait staff....all are flawless in their service.  The food always delicious and cooked to perfection.  We have never been disappointed, though this last visit, we were somewhat surprised to see our filet mignon steaks looking like a typical flat sirloin and not the rounder taller filet we had been accustomed to.  It was also not the \"melt-in-your-mouth\" tenderness we come to expect.  We didn't say anything as the flavor was outstanding, but I would question it if presented with the same next time we dine there.  The chargrilled cauliflower was amazing as were the teriyaki tenderloin bites we had as an appetizer.\nI would highly recommend the Metropolitan Grill to anyone wanting a fine dining experience in a more casual comfortable setting.  You can't go wrong here!",

I really enjoyed looking at all of the pictures in the lobby of various \u201cfamous\u201d guests who have dined there. The restaurant itself is very loud. I was nervous about being able to hear our own conversation, but luckily we were seated towards the back where it was a bit quieter. The food itself was okay, but not worth the price. I ordered the bacon wrapped tenderloin, which was honestly a very great quality steak. My husband ordered the chicken and it had a thick layer of fat coating it, and it wasn\u2019t very good. We also ordered the caramel bacon and it could have been seared a bit longer. It was also very fatty. I have an egg allergy and had questions about different desert options and I felt as though our server wasn\u2019t the most helpful. I don\u2019t expect anyone to know every ingredient but I thought she could have at least gone to the kitchen to check if a particular desert contained eggs. The restaurant itself is very outdated. The bathroom was pretty gross. Overall I would say the experience wasn't worth the price. Our tab was close to $200 and we could have gotten the same quality at half the price. If the ambience were better maybe I\u2019d go again, but there was just nothing that stood out as exceptional.",

After we rejected the market price crab appetizer she tried pushing on us twice, she neglected us, forgetting a glass of wine, a requested side of horseradish sauce and never asking about our entrees. She did bring a comped glass of wine much later. She poured my bottle of beer at the table....filling the glass with foam. We were going to order dessert and after dinner drinks but refrained when she\u2019d left us alone with our boxed leftovers for over ten minutes. Her support staff made up for her somewhat and were lovely. The food was just okay. My prime rib was poorly seasoned and full of gristle. Brussels sprouts were soggy. The bacon appetizer was interesting but too big and unwieldy, a bit of overkill. Cauliflower was nicely seasoned but unevenly cooked with raw parts in one side and burned on the other.

The sommelier was a disappointment, vague in his recommendations and descriptions, and failed to inspire confidence.  The wine list (which is extensive) is, IMHO, not well thought out and, for many of the selections, outrageously overpriced even by restaurant standards.  There are a paucity of interesting selections in the $60-80 range that I was targeting for our meal. The food was expensive and just OK. The steaks were perfectly cooked, but honestly nothing better than the average chain steak house servings, and at a considerably higher (2x) price. The salads were uninspired and covered with an overly tart dressing.  The king salmon was blah. On the upside, the bar scene looked lively.

There was one server (and another who eventually brought us some water and bread after us asking) who failed to come to the table for such a long time and even greet us...we had to go look for a manager to order cocktails. Service did not get any better from there. I was skeptical when were seated in this room because this is usually the case, but thought I would be optimistic.  The food was good not great ( probably because we were so upset at this point) but honestly the service was so bad it ruined our dinner. The room has absolutely no ambiance because you are isolated from the entire restaurant. That combined with the horrible service made for such a disappointing night. In addition, when the check came the 18% sc was added. Hence the horrible service. Ironically enough, I tip 25 to 30%. We were looking so forward to this dinner, as it was a special occasion with many flying in from out of state. We had such a great experience here before....so disappointed this night.",

This was my first time at this restaurant and my boyfriend and I had a joint birthday dinner with a few other friends, 6 people in total at our table. We ordered the Seafood Sampler and the selection of seafood was as fresh as it if has just been pulled from the sea. A few people in our group noted the presentation was not as striking as it has been in years past since now the sampler is served on more of a platter instead of a tower.  We also tried the Japanese Tartare which was also excellent, if you enjoy tartare. \n\nMost of the group ordered Wagyu Filet Mignon with various sides, and a bottle of Fidelitas to wash it down.   After polishing off a few drinks and the appetizers, there wasn't much room left for the main course so be sure to bring your appetite. The meat was done perfectly, lightly pink and warm throughout just as the server advised. One person ordered the salmon, which she reported was excellent. if you enjoy potatoes, you must try the roasted poblano scalloped potatoes and you will be in scalloped potato heaven. As an added surprise, our server brought us each a birthday candle lit creme brulee. Creme brulee happens to be my most favorite dessert, and it was out of this world silky, creamy, slightly sweet with the perfect amount of glassy caramelized crunchy burnt sugar on top. Our server was a delight, always right at hand without hovering, and went out of her way to take a picture of our group for us. \n\nIf you are looking to treat yourself and feel like a royalty, or just enjoy an impeccable meal in a relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere, the Met is for you!",

My steak was slightly overcooked and lacking seasoning (I should\u2019ve known when the waiter suggested pouring au jus on it). In my opinion, a $74 steak shouldn\u2019t need additional dressing.\n\nWe ordered Brussels sprouts as a side and about 50% of them were undercooked. The wine suggested by the sommelier was also mediocre (4-star rating on Vivino; $83 for a $39 retail bottle of wine).\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and provided complementary creme brulee for our anniversary. Total bill (w/ tip) was $400.\n\nThe Met is an iconic restaurant in downtown Seattle and definitely worth experiencing at least once; however, in my opinion, Seattle has other, superior culinary options for much less than $400.",

The baked potatoe was ordered with sour cream and chives, it was presented with cheese sauce; by the time condiments were changed the potatoe had assumed room temp.

They went and got the sommelier and when  he came I explained the wine I was curious about.  Then I mentioned, again,  \"by the glass.\"  He closed the menu, and rudely told me they don't serve that wine by the glass, scoffed to himself and walked away.  I laughed at this because I heard how pretentious this restaurant is and his behavior was so on point. I then had to ask for the tab a few times which led to the paying experience.  They now use hand held devices at the table for you to pay at the table.  But when I went to pay my server was right over my shoulder and when it came to the tip, the screen showed 20% *(which I usually tip anyway) but the server was aggressively telling me to hit \"next\"   on the screen, over and over , so that I could not change the tip and then he took the machine from me and gave himself a 5 star rating?   It was the oddest dining experience I have had to date and the food was not that great either.  The only good thing was the look of the restaurant.  The green velvet booths are nice.

The food was not very good as my daughter and I had to send our steaks back twice as they were raw. They left our potatoes at the table which ended up being cold when we did get our steaks back, which we were still unable to eat. The table was hardly even cleaned as we had to end up stacking all the dishes at the end of the table till they decided to pick them up. The table was not wiped down. We ordered two desserts to be made tableside which was another big disappointment. We asked for Kevin to make them and they told us he was off and they were shorthanded. The desserts were terrible with stuff flying all over the table and into the wrong desserts. We still left the waiter a $80.00 tip on a $420.00 bill which I feel he was not deserving of.",

We opted for the carrot cake and it was fabulous. I would definitely go back for the carrot cake. The steaks that we order were completely opposite from each other. One was very chewy, while the other melted in your mouth. The salmon was not worth the value, and was over cooked. The lobster Mac & cheese was good, loved the chunks of lobster, as well as the herbed roasted vegetables!! Other than that, enjoyed the ambiance, and our drinks!!!!",

Well, we got there and quickly felt our hunger increase looking at the menu's mouth-watering steaks. We started off with the oysters which were phenomenal and both got different cuts of filet -- really, really great steak. We did the brussel's sprouts on the side which were perfect. (I was surprised to see the 'sides' section of the menu; I had expected more -- but turns out it isn't truly a la carte & your steak does come with a choice of starch/veggie!). The service from our waiter was great, and it was an overall great experience. Pricey, but worth it for a special occasion.",

When you walk in this place has the look and feel of a classic steakhouse with a lot of wood and it is located in an older building which just adds to the charm. The menu isn't huge but that is a good thing which usually means they do everything really well. The staff is super friendly and the service is excellent. I ordered the 12oz peppercorn NY Strip with the mashed potatoes on the side. It came out piping hot and it simply couldn't have been cooked or tasted any better. It cut so easily and tasted so perfectly it really did seem to melt. This is hands down one of the best steaks I have ever had and it was worth every dollar I paid for it.",

The food is top-quality that I just can't duplicate on my own. \n\nAnd my favorite part is they are very transparent about what items come with sides and what items are a la carte. That is the piece that frustrates me the most with many fine-dining establishments is a presentation that implies it's all inclusive but they charge for each piece. I don't mind paying for it, I just want transparency and honesty. The Met gives that to me in spades so I've never gone back to other places (like Daniel's Broiler). Highly recommended!",

The hostess tried to seat us at a tiny 2-top in the corner of the upper level adjacent to the kitchen, where people would be passing behind one seat constantly. When I asked if a booth was available and mentioned that I'd requested one when I made the the reservation on Open Table, she said she hadn't seen the request and did take us to a booth instead (the restaurant was not terribly busy). I had also mentioned in the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday. Neither the hostess or the server mentioned it or asked about it. We've been coming to the Met for years, often on birthdays or anniversaries, so I expected a little more personalized attention. We never even got the server's name. In particular, now that a 20% service charge is applied automatically, I feel like the staff needs to make a little more effort.",

The Olive beef coated your mouth in what seemed like silky olive oil but it was a steak. If you are a steak lover, you must go here. The server we had, Tom, was outstanding. He was very knowledgeable and treated us like family. The only knock would have been the crab cakes. There was too much filling and the crab was all minced leaving no lumps of crab IMO.",

The wife raved about her meal and how it was perfect.  Her steak was cooked to her liking and the sides were delicious.  The salad was fresh and crispy and the bread was fresh as well.   \n\nMy steak was not to my liking (well done) and when I returned it to the kitchen, it returned to me under-cooked.  My opinion of the MG sank.  When our server asked how I would like my meat cooked, I stated well done.  He replied, there will be a little pink inside and I totally understood what he was speaking on be cause other locations we have frequented have stated the same.  The difference in those locations and the MG.....the other locations served the meal and the plate was usually hot, which meant the meat was still cooking will on the plate and as I ate, the meat would continue to cook.  My plate was not even warm.  Initially, I am done with a place if I am not pleased.  But while at the MG, we saw another couple we had seen earlier in the day and began talking about Seattle and how they were visiting just as we were and they stated their meal was prepared the way they both desired.  \n\nTherefore, I have concluded when I return to Seattle I will give the MG another try.",

She explained everything and was very polite and professional with a sense of humor. We ordered three different salads. They were all excellent and the plate was loaded. We then ordered three different meals. My son had what I believed they called the top hat sirloin and a baked potato. It was cooked to perfection he said. He loved it as he should for a $72 steak. I had the peppercorn crusted NY Strip. Though it was cooked the way I liked it it was too fatty for me. So for $64 I wasn't thrilled. My wife had a seafood Alfredo that she said was good but it had mushrooms in it which she didn't realize when ordering. Though a minor setback.  We then split a dessert that was white chocolate and coconut cake which was outstanding. Overall it was good but not sure if we would return on our next trip back.

This was by far the best meal and dining experience we had all week, and there were other really good ones. Our waiter Bruno, with the distinct baritone voice, was at once engaging and knowledgeable and may be reason enough by himself to return here should we pass this way again! He was truly a pleasure to engage with while making it fun for the girls and informative for us.  And our dessert waiter Craig, who expertly prepared the deconstructed apple pie (a must have) alongside our table was equally delightful. He even followed us outside to take a pic of us with the restaurant as backdrop - a bonus for sure. Both of these gentlemen have worked here over 20 years and, upon playing our family game post-meal describing the experience in 1 word, I chose 'professional', for they truly epitomize the term. And the food? As good as the service was the steaks & potatoes we were served were near the top in taste & quality as any we've had. This is an old-school steakhouse with pricing to match, but well worth it for special occasions, important business liaisons or when you just want a great meal with service to match!",

The bone in ribeye was OK, but not great. The fillet was most disappointing. How do you have gristle and grainy stuff in a fillet?  We shared the wedge salad and it was good, and the baked potato was outstanding.  If the price point had been about half of what it was, we still would not have been impressed.

I asked for a \u2018quiet area\u2019 table and our party of five was seated at a banquet round typically for 8-10. This would have been ok, but the restaurant used the room for a party with two five or so year old girls who ran back and forth throughout the room and neither the parents or the management thought to stop the activity. Mid way through the meal they added a family with a new born to another banquet table in the mix and, fortunately, she or he slept.\n\nService was poorly timed and we had a wait if 30-40 minutes between appetizer course and main entre. My blackened prime rib ordered medium (pink throughout by restaurant definition) was medium well. It was also 1/2 fat. My wife had a regular prime rib and it was almost cold and also not prepared as ordered. Entres were not dropped together which also seemed odd. The bread were a stingy portion and we had to ask for more rather than it being replenished. On a side table were four floral arrangements which could have been placed on the four banquet tables making the evening more festive.\n\nFor $665 we could have easily found a much better meal at a chain steakhouse for 2/3 the cost or less for our party of five. The Met came highly recommended by a former Seattle resident ... unfortunately it appears time has worn on the rep of the Metropolitan Grill.

I had made reservations about a week and a half beforehand. The hostess was very nice but everything went downhill from there on. We were a party of 5 and led to a table that sets at least 10. It had an odd flower arrangement on it that looked like it was left over from a shower or something, no big deal though. The service was mediocre at best, took quite a long while for anyone to come over and ask if we wanted drinks and even longer for the drinks to be delivered. Needless to say the prices here are not for the faint of heart which is truly fine if you have an incredible experience. That was not the case. The person who delivered our meals was not the original waitress and had no idea who had what. We were passing plates around until it was straightened out.  I had ordered my stake medium but it was very rare, it was also cold, by the time anyone came by again it was 15 minutes into our meal and too late to send back and since it took so long to get to us anyway I was not about to hold everyone up by sending it back. Bottom line, SO expensive and I have had a better steak at Outback. Think they are trying to cash in on their history as a great steak house in years gone by but trust me this is not the place it used to be.",

        "Content": "Still one of the best in Seattle.  Decided to come here with my bride of 47 years for an Anniversary Dinner and was not disappointed. The food and service were excellent from the valet to the sommelier.  We had a great meal. Warning, the steaks are cooked to traditional standards; that is, if you ask for med rare, you will get red and warm in the middle. Most folks who want \"medium rare\" really want \"pink\" in the middle, which is \"medium\" here and and at most other first tier steak houses.  My only surprise was a 3% Surcharge added to my bill. The manager, Paul, happened to walk by and when I asked him, he did a very good job of explaining why this was added. With the recent minimum wage in Seattle and the increase in \"hotel and restaurant\" taxes, their choice was to raise prices (already very high with most steaks going for $60+) or to add an automatic 18% gratuity. He explained that a \"tip\" was not a right but given for good service, and also that the tips only went to the wait staff who were already the highest paid employees in the restaurant. Rather than doing that, they added this 3% surcharge which was then divided among all of the employees equally.  That made more sense to me and sounds like a creative and more fair solution. And again, the service from everyone was five star.  I would recommend this place for it's excellent food, unbelievable wine list, excellent service and great atmosphere. Just  be prepared for a high end price for this high end meal.",

I must say, it wasn\u2019t bad but it wasn\u2019t that good either.  When the meat came out, it literally took one of the waiter at least 10 min to finish dividing our portions.  By that time, the meat has cooled down.  I am a believer in hot food fresh off the grill/oven or whatever.  When you pay for high end product, you need to give high end results.  We should have ordered individual plates.  Also, side orders were warm as well. \nWe had a good time because it was about our friendship and we were from out of town ( California).  Let\u2019s just say, the restaurant did not leave up to the hyped.",

Also the table was adjacent to a service area so it wasn\u2019t romantic or quiet for a special occasion- so poor request accOmadation by the restaurant.  The service definitely wasn\u2019t aware of the occasion so didnt make it a surprise- somewhat of a lapse and on the restaurants part.  The initial service felt somewhat rushed- seemed like the server was trying to cram the entire order at one sitting which was annoying.  Food was very good but was overprIced- 70$ for a great steak is Steep.  Desert was tasty but far from memorable- we had creme Brulee.  Overall i liked and didn\u2019t love this spot. Thought the food was good but not memorable and given lapses in requests and price point- I think there are better options available in Seattle.",

I think she did this because we had our children with us (who are extremely well behaved and eat off of the adult menu).  I watched people come into the restaurant wearing sweat pants, ripped jeans and ball caps and all of them were given better tables than us.  In retrospect I should have requested a better table.

It was rated at one of top spots to eat in Seattle.\n\nMy husband is a big steak and seafood guy. Back home in DC, the Capital Grill is his go to spot. I do not eat red meat...or seafood, but being a very special night, I decided to give steak a go! \n\nThe ambiance of the Metropolitan was very laid and bright and I very much enjoyed this.  They greeted us warmly and took our reservation right away, along with our coats. \n\nUnfortunately, I think we got probably the very worst waiter in the restaurant.  And my husband grumbled about him all night long.  He did not explain the different cut of meat, the menu, or offer any service to write home about.  We longed at the other tables and their wait staff wishing we were seated anywhere but where we were. The others were bright, enthusiastic and so detailed about the menu it had you excited about your meal! \n\nHowever, I will say, the lovely gentlemen who explained the wine menu to us and who made my husband\u2019s Apple crisp made the evening bearable! \n\nOh, and the food!!!!! Definitely made up for the lack of service.  The steaks were cooked to perfection! We started with the onion rings with curry Sauce and finished with carrot cake and apple crisp.\n\nOverall, a wonderful place to eat, if you can get the right service!",

Per the suggestion of Phai, our server, my 9 year old ordered the sirloin from the kids menu at about a fifth of the cost of the adult version. I had the king crab legs and my 18 year old ordered the filet on bone with peppercorn sauce in the side. Everything was spot on in terms of prep and flavor. Couldn\u2019t fault anything.

In my wildest dreams, I never thought for a second I would encounter overt racism at The Metropolitan Grill - but we did.  I had a scholarship recipient of our non-profit with us.  In fact, the lunch was for him.  In all the many years I as a white male have eaten at this restaurant (frequently) I have never, not once, been lectured by wait-staff when I ordered a refill of a strawberry lemonade (or any drink) that refills are not included in the original price, that a refill would cost.  But when our African American student ordered a refill he was given an overt, rude, lecture that refills are charged.  Frankly, I lost it and let the waiter know in no uncertain terms I was, really, thunderstruck by his rudeness and message.  Lola, FareStart, Wild Ginger, are not within a block of my office, as is The Metropolitan Grill, but that is where I will be going in the future.  Almost assuredly never again will I carry my wallet into The Metropolitan Grill.  Postscript:  the blond white lady (another guest of mine) and I (white male) had our entrees arrive expeditiously.  For our student (black male), I had to complain to management that his entree had not yet arrived even as of when we were through with our lunches.",

Simply put, ...they were openly (almost) overwhelmed.\nThe food was, as usual, superior. \nOur waiter, (Todd), was, as usual, the perfect spokesperson for the restaurant....Friendly, knowledgeable & informed on nuances that might have slipped past others (our female guest LOVED the blue cheese suggestion !)\nOverall, in my personal opinion, this place continues, to set the bar others HOPE to achieve. \nIt simply cannot & will not, fail to impress.\nEven with the recent remodel, the \"feel\" remains the same,..(for me).\nNeedless to say, we'll keep going back...ESPECIALLY if /when we are inclined to treat ourselves to any of the(ir) outstanding beef offerings.\nTEN STARS!!",

You guys need to rise to the occasion. My other nit is the failed crab cakes. I don't remember there being noticeable carrot pieces in the cake, like this time. Also, who ever was cooking them became distracted as the bottom of the cakes were dark and hard, requiring a knife to cut them. There was minimal breading on two of the cakes, as expected from past experience, but the third, it was doughy, about half of it was that way. The Met and the Bistro had been neck and neck on the carb cakes, this time, your cakes were very disappointing. I left a review on the Met's web site as well. I live in Arlington, so coming to Seattle to the Met is a serious effort to be pleased. Not this time. The wedge salads were excellent as was our steaks, but they could not make up for the poor performance on the drinks and crab cakes.

I wanted the pea salad from the lunch menu and, although it was touch and go for a minute, the waitress found a way to make it happen. The wine list is huge. Perhaps overwhelming but lots of great wines. Highly recommend this place. \ud83d\ude04",

The reservation was at 7:30 and our entrees did not arrive until 930. My son, whose birthday we were celebrating, had to run off immediately after finishing his entr\u00e9e because the service took so long.  It made for an uncomfortable dining experience.  The food was fine but the overall experience was actually stressful as we were concerned about Server's attitude AND the slowness of the meal. This experience cost $1,000.

My family and I have been loyal members to the Met for the last three decades, we come in for special occasions and always look forward to the experience we\u2019ve come to expect.  Our dinner Saturday night was not up to par however, three different steaks were ordered and all three were not good, one had to be sent back for being undercooked after requesting medium well and wasn\u2019t served until everyone else had finished eating.  The service was decent and the server refunded the steak that was sent back and ultimately wasn\u2019t eatable but the food overall was sub par.  As we drove home and discussed our meal  we realized we should let someone at the Met know.  I sent them a message via Facebook that night and a rep responded stating a manager would follow up, however that was four days ago and I\u2019ve checked back once and was told thanks for my patience.  Not only did this meal wreck my family\u2019s  mental picture of the Met but their lack of follow up makes me feel they don\u2019t value me as the loyal customer that I have been since the early 90\u2019s. Unfortunately I wouldn\u2019t recommend the Met as I wouldn\u2019t want this same experience to happen to anyone else, especially considering the price you pay for this upper end food.",

The rib-eye was solidly good - even better than either of the offered Wagyus.  We got our steaks cooked medium to medium well and they were very 'chewy' and did not have the taste and flavor anticipated and certainly did not match the price.  The au jus was really good and essential to the steaks flavor.  The baked potato was very good, but how can you mess up a baked potato.  The lobster mac and cheese was just okay- a little fishy tasting and not super cheesy.  The service was mostly attentive.  If I returned, I would go for the ribeye or porterhouse for the best value.",

This time though it seemed we had a slow/inexperienced waiter. \n\nWe had to ask multiple times for normal service items (Like sour cream/onions for our baked potato, bread for the table)\nAlso, there was plenty of wait time between courses. We wanted to order dessert, however we waited about 15 minutes after we were done eating our main courses to even receive our dessert menus. Then we had to wait to order the dessert. \nFinally, when our left overs were packaged, we usually get a bag to take them home- instead we just received the boxes without bags.\n\nFood was still good, although my steak seemed more on the medium than the medium rare side. I give this a pass because you should speak up if you don't like it the way it was served. I decided it wasn't over-cooked enough to make a big stink about it and therefore, it was on me.\n\nPeople choose restaurants like this not just for the food, but the overall consistency in service, presentation, food, experience. From that baseline, i would say this was a less than average experience when i compare it to the many times i've come before.",

For dinner, I ordered the prime rib medium rare and my fianc\u00e9 had the New York Strip I medium rare.  Knowing steaks were what they were famous for, we knew that's what we wanted to try and our expectations were pretty high. His steak came out with absolutely no pink to it. It was dry, tough, and not even the overly salty au jus sauce could bring any flavor to it. Although my prime rib came out medium rare, I was not wowed by the flavor. The garlic mash potato side was more of a hard lump lobbed on the side of plate. Our waiter was very kind and attentive, but neither of us are ones to send food back or make a scene, more of lesson learned people, plus we had a show to attend without the time for our food to be redone. $250 later and a bitter taste in our mouth, we will not be returning or recommending it to anyone.",

We were greeted warmly  at the door by the door man. There was coat service but none provided. There was confusion whether tables were ready when there was a reservation made and only a half an hour into opening.  The server tried to make small talk and name drop of all the people who has dined there to accentuate the place.  It took over an hour for the main course to arrive. No explanation whatsoever.  We mentioned that we had another event to catch and offered our card. The server took the card and of course forgot about bringing back the tab. Overall it was a disappointment. Price is hefty but the food didnt match it. It wasnt worth to mention to others back home. It was overrated and recommend other places to dine for special occasion or when visiting Seattle.",

The steaks were superb! ...as were our Manhattan cocktails. Equally wonderful we\u2019re the lauded baked  potato and the creamer spinach. The highlight of our meal was a made-at-the-table cherries jubilee for dessert. Our server made a special trip into the kitchen to see if they had ingredients to make cherries jubilee, since only bananas foster and apple jubilee have been on the menu the last two years. We were really happy to hear they would make Cherries Jubilee for our anniversary celebration. Metropolitan Grill is NOT cheap, but we think it is well worth saving all year to visit!",

I didn't feel quite so out of place after that.  lol\n\nThe ambiance is a tad fancier than we're used to, but not snobbishly so.  The menu was easy to read and pretty straight forward.  The waitstaff was super friendly and helpful.  They poured au jus on our steaks, they fixed up our potatoes for us, and dished up all the toppings for them as well, they even boxed up our leftovers FOR us!\n\nThe steak was amazing.  The baked potato was amazing.  The cheese sauce they pour on it is to die for.  Honestly I'll be back.  Since Seattle is a 3 hour trip away it's not going to be anytime soon, but the next time the boyfriend and I have a weekend away - I'll definitely consider heading back to Seattle and The Met again.",

I asked about the menu and he gave us a regular menu.  We ordered a soup and some salad then some fillets for the main course.  Fillets were cooked as ordered but really lacked flavor and had a weird fatty part on the side.  Once finished with the main course I had to ask for a desert menu, nothing was offered.  Ordered the chocolate cake which was the best part of the meal.  \n\nOverall, I expected more from the Met.  Service was lacking, very slow however he was friendly when with us.

My own personal disappointment was that the flavor of the small filet I had was a bit bland. Our Bananas Foster was the dramatic and delicious finale.",

Having a light snow falling in downtown made the evening more festive.\n\nI haven't been to the Met in alittle while because I need to watch what type of protein I eat for my health.  Thinking it would be a nice treat for myself on Christmas Eve to eat a big piece of meat.  \nIn the beginning, I was properly meet with the server, and he told me all the specials for the evening.  He delivered my appetizer, my drink, and my entree efficiency with grace and nice chatting.  The food is good, I had the bone rib-eye with the largest baked potato I have seen for sometime.  \n\nWhat bothered me was the lack of attentive care after I finished my entree.  I waited more than 15 minutes after my plate was taken by the bus person before I could order my cheese cake.  Then when I finished my dessert, I waited another 25 minutes plus to get my check.  I don't know if it was being on a holiday evening or the lack to keep up on who the server is covering when they may be preoccupied with another table.  I had to ask the bus person again for assistance.  Everything in beginning was good, but the 3rd act was lacking in service.  It surprised me alittle being this establishment is on the higher end on the price range.  The food is really good, and service from the start was positive.  Just afterwards it left me having doubts on coming back again.  It's possible I need to go there on a non holiday evening or is it possible solo diners are treated differently?",

We also got scallops, and lobster Mac and cheese.  It was perfection all the way around from service to food to ambiance. \n\nSecond time around completely the opposite. The service was slow and the food was meh. We ordered the snow beef which was way below the quality of the ohmi. I\u2019d compare it more to prime. It was also severely under cooked, purplish in the middle. Also ordered the 35 year aged top cap, which was very good (better than the $120 snow beef). It was an unfortunate experience for us because we held met grill in such high regard and recommended it to all our friends. Also it\u2019s pricey for 2 people a couple drinks and food was $400. Honestly the snow beef filet was equal to $60 filets  we\u2019ve had at multiple restaurants and the marbeling left a lot to be desired when compared to ohmi or even American wagyu. We both tend to think we got a prime cut on accident. We\u2019ll chalk this up to a bad day and we\u2019ll give them another chance one day.",

The Met has a reputation of being a fine dining restaurant and my husband and I were ready to pay the price to treat the family to a very nice, classy meal. Everything was going peachy keen until the first course came. I ordered a spinach salad and as I was picking at my salad for a choice bite, I found a hair. Of course the waiter, Juergen, was extremely apologetic and offered to send a new salad; I just couldn\u2019t eat another morsel. It completely ruined my appetite. The GM (well, who I thought was the GM because he was dressed in a tuxedo) came to the table and apologized profusely\u2014probably because I was morose and the errant hair killed my vibe. You think I\u2019m moody? Well, who wouldn\u2019t get grossed out by something like that? (Questions racing in my head during dinner: What part of the body did this hair come from? Why is it at the bottom of my plate?) I\u2019m just glad our other family members didn\u2019t have an issue\u2014I would have been completely mortified.\n\nIn order to remedy the situation, the Met comped my salad, comped the dessert course which consisted of tableside bananas foster, the nine-layer chocolate cake, the white chocolate coconut cake, and a big scoop of the a la carte ice cream. They also comped my mother-in-law\u2019s and my valet tickets. They probably did the absolute best they could in order to fix the first course mishap, which I do appreciate.\n\nDo I think the Met is a fine dining restaurant? No. The website says the dress code is business casual and people are walking in with jeans and hooded sweatshirts (also, the hair issue).\nDoes the staff care about their customers? Yes. However, you can\u2019t expect to lift the mood of a customer after you start your meal with a hair.\nIs the food good? Yes, but be wary. Quality Control in the kitchen isn\u2019t up to snuff, especially at the prices the customer pays to dine there.",

The calamari appetizer we had was clumpy and doughy. I had the rib cap steak with root vegetables. The steak was cooked nicely but the root vegetables varied from borderline raw to mush. My wife had the bacon wrapped filet and mashed potatoes. I was surprised to see the fillet was cut into 2 very thin portions. I would think that a steak house of this level would understand it is hard to get a perfect medium rare on such thin pieces of meat. Her fillet was medium to medium well. My daughter had the fettuccine with prawns and crab. The prawns were nicely cooked. The amount of crab and prawns was acceptable. The fresh noodles needed another minute or two in the water as they were way too firm. The sauce was greasy and seemed to have broken. \nOur sides were lobster mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts. The top of the mac and cheese had been left under the broiler so long that the  noodles had the texture of raw packaged noodles. The Brussels sprouts were nicely caramelized on the outside but raw crunchy in the middle. \nThe desert cakes were the best part of the meal and delicious. \nAfter reading all the reviews and deciding on eating at the Metropolitan Grill, for the money we spent I would expect that they could figure out how to properly prepare the sides of the meal.  Serving what they call world class steaks with haphazardly thrown together sides is just not acceptable. Very disappointed that our first visit will be our last. We have eaten far superior meals for much less.",

Bruno permitted us the leisure we wanted and was superb in his recommendations as I was looking to expand my beef horizons a bit.

The atmosphere reminds me of the \"old school\" style restaurants I used to go to in New York and New Jersey when I was a kid. It's cozy and welcoming and comfortable. The waiter was friendly and got to know us as people, which is important to me. We even found out he's our neighbor!

Was placed adjacent a servers cart which was moved in & out and when speaking to the Host, he said it was going to do that. He did not offer a substitute table (clearly available) or really cared. The serving table was actually used  for placing dirty dishes and cardboard boxes for take home leftovers that we were able to view throughout the dining experience. So, if you want to go to a place that thinks you should thank them for being able to eat there, this is your place. The low score on ambience is a reflection of this experience. The Sommelier said nothing when opening the wine, was disinterested when I commented on the wine (did not respond) and I guess cause my bottle was only $90.  My 1st visit was more enjoyable. The waiter was better but not particularly engaged but if not for him service would be 1 star. We also ate at Shucker's and Capitol Grill on this trip and both were far more inviting, interactive and enjoyable. Not sure I will be back to test the 3 is the charm.

We didn\u2019t see our server for another 10 minutes, and when he did come by he apologized for not being by sooner and thanked us for our patience... And said he\u2019d be back soon... He returned 10 minutes later and we placed all orders- drinks, appetizers and meal - as we had no idea when he\u2019d be back.  The drinks came a while later and they got one wrong, but quickly fixed it... Then we had the burger cut into 1/4s to share as an appetizer and it was perfect.  Then our meals were served.  Three of us had bagels with lox, and one had a scramble.  The scramble was ok... Nothing special, but ok.  The bagels were terrible.  All were hard, but one in particular was inedible... it was as if it had been stale, and then toasted too much, and then sat out until it cooled.  It was seriously too hard to eat... the \u201cfixings\u201d with it (lox, onion, cream cheese, etc.) were ok, but nothing special.  The other two bagels were also awful, but not as bad... It was truly disappointing.  We chose not to complain or send the bagels   back as we needed to get to the game - and everything had taken so long already.  We won\u2019t make the mistake to go to the Met again.  We stopped at The Cherry Street Public House today for breakfast, and their \u201csalmon toast\u201d, which is served on a bagel, was perfect... It was as good as we should have been served at The Met.",

Waiter asked if they were good we said no and he said no problem I will get U something else. So we ordered the prawn cocktail and that was really good! Thought he would take it off the bill but he didn\u2019t. Spending $100 a plate and an overall bill of around $450 and not including the tip I gave the waiter.

I was a little apprehensive that it might be a little too upmarket, but was soon put at ease by the warm friendly welcome.  Our waiting staff were absolutely fantastic, especially when ordering our dishes and giving recommendations . I had seen other reviews about the \"Chateaubriand\" and was informed that this would not only be an excellent choice but also experience.  So we ordered the Dungeness & Alaskan King crab cakes, the Almond crusted Scallops & the \"Chateaubriand\". The wine waiter provided assistance on choosing an excellent red to accompany our dish and we had the best meal ever! The staff make sure your experience is simply the best. We loved having the Chateaubriand carved at our table as  the person carving it was thoroughly engaging & entertaining albeit quite serious about his responsibility. Sadly but as expected we were unable to order desserts. This experience does not come cheap but in our opinion, it was the best money  ever spent on a dining out experience in 33 years. Thanks to all at The Metropolitan Grill, Seattle.",

The Old Fashioned I ordered was top notch and the wine list is extensive.  Oh, and the chocolate cake was decadent.  Dinner wasn't cheap (especially for two public school teachers) but the portions were generous and worth the splurge. \n\nTopping it all off was the great treatment we received from the staff.  Our waiter was  personable, there when we needed him and gone when we didn't.   I wish I remembered his name so I could compliment him  publicly. The busser was also very pleasant and unobtrusive.",

Since I like my steak pink in the middle I went with well done which was not pink in the middle instead there was no pink at all & the steak was dry, besides the fact that the piece I got was thin it also had fat all around the edge so basically leaving very little steak to eat as I don't eat the fat. Very very disappointed. Then for some reason I was served a potatoe soaked with butter already in it, when I told the waiter I didn't want butter in my potatoe he said \"ok I'll go grab you another potatoe\" and he did but it was almost cold, not fresh out of the oven. Then he slopped a huge amount of sour cream on top making it worst. A plate that cost +$70's\nFor a potatoe & steak should at least have a hot  Potatoe not one that has been seating around for a while.",

But when the bill arrived, I noticed that they had added a 3% surcharge, and in bold letters, \"THIS IS NOT A GRATUITY\". Well, what is it then? Why don't they just make the menu items cost 3% more and be honest about the prices? I guess I should be grateful it wasn't a 50% surcharge?\n\nSo no, I won't be returning, because a surprise 3% surcharge (or any percentage) is an insult. \n\nI wonder if they would have appreciated it if I simply deducted an automatic 10% patronage discount?",

Our steaks were excellent, make sure to have your server walk you through the menu and their \"doneness\" levels, since different places have different standards. I had the R&R filet and brussel sprouts, both fantastic. My mom's lobster bisque was some of the best I've tasted, clearly crafted with care.

She said a manager would be over but that did not happen. They removed the steak from our bill but this did not make up for the poor service and tough steak.

I strayed from my old favorites and tried out the  4oz filet trio ( for $125!). The Japanese , high end cut was almost inedible. Just too many tendons ( and I know the difference  between tendons and marbling) made it very difficult to even cut with their awesome knives. for $60 for a 4 oz cut, I don't expect to have to knaw away by hand, especially on a filet cut. Because we were having a celebration I chose not to complain, which in hindsight, was not my best choice. Should have sent it back. I will always love the Met and the outstanding service, but will not be so quick to go out of my lane where I know I will be happy.

We enjoyed couple of  appetizers and drinks, but the main course was not what we expect from the Metropolitan. I ordered the blackened prime rib and my husband ordered the bacon wrapped beef  medallion. Although, it states on the menu that the prim rib will contain some fat. I didn't expect that half of the portion would be fat. They were also a little  generous  with the spices on the prime rib, which made it hard to taste the meat flavor.

We were sat about 15 minutes before our reservation. The hostesses were incredibly friendly and our server was the best of the best. His knowledge of the menu was superb and he gave us incredible recommendations to help us choose the perfect meals and appetizers. The Alaskan salmon was the best salmon I've ever had. My husband had the skirt steak which was tender and flavorful. Definitely a \"hidden gem\" on the menu! The crab cakes were divine, as were the asparagus and Brussels sprouts we had as our side dishes, which we substituted for our potatoes. We received a complimentary dessert, the burnt creme, for our anniversary and it was absolutely decadent! I have a sweet tooth, so we ordered the white chocolate coconut cake to go and it was hands down the best cake I have ever had! This restaurant is absolutely worth the price.

When I complained, they promptly moved us to a booth which was much better; however I felt like I was sitting too low in relation to the table.  The food was very good.  My one complaint was that we ordered the large porterhouse; which we planned to split. The steak was cooked perfectly; however the method they used to split the steak for us sort of ruined it in my opinion.  Instead of taking the strip and the filet off the bone and cutting it in slices, the waiter cut the steak in half lengthwise which yielded a piece of meat that looked more like a piece of prime rib than a steak.",

It was excellent and the apple cinnamon flambe was outstanding. It is prepared tableside and three of us shared the dessert. Really was tasty and wonderful. I had a filet which was good, my daughter had a combination of waygu beef and regular beef and my husband had steak salad. Steak salad seemed to be prepared with very little left over steak and was not worth the price. The service seemed to be off. The server we had asked us to order entres before we even ordered drinks. Then he disappeared and eventually returned with water, then disappeared again. He may have been covering other tables but we felt alternately ignored and rushed.

We were presented with the check and it included $26 charge for ...... (wait for it) ........desert.

        "Content": "My husband and I had dinner here last week and OMGEEEE the food was amazing! I usually eat seafood vs poultry or livestock, so I ordered the crab   pasta and it was delicious! I am pasta picky and prefer \"grown up\" very flavorful and savory pasta dishes, vs the usual bland and overly cheesy kiddie pasta most chains offer. For a steak house, the pasta was very impressive! It had several huge chunks of fresh crab meat too! My hubby ordered steak and I had a few bites and it was soooooooo good! The best steak I have had out before hands down! We also ordered the almond scallop appetizer, and it was ok but not worth the price. They cut the scallops in half and fry them in butter. We would have preferred a few full size scallops just seared instead. The heavily buttered crust and economy size cheapens the taste and appearance of the scallops IMO. I also had the pear lemon drop and it was stiff and tasty! We finished off with dessert, I got cheesecake and he ordered the ice cream, both were  great! Our server was charming, friendly, and very attentive. The decor was very dated for some reason...all forest green and brown inside and felt very 80's fine dining. However that didn't' really matter to us, but if you are wanting an aesthetically pleasing \"wow e'm\" modern setting then this isn't the place. If you're a foodie like us and mainly care about flavor and service, this is one of the best restaurants in WA, let alone Seattle! If its in your budget/want to have a special meal out, the Met is absolutely worth every penny. We left full and very happy :)",

Wine selection was amazing, as they had a large amount of half bottles (perfect as only my husband drinks wine).  They also had three cider selections, which I was pleased with.  The calamari was amazing, probably the best I've ever had (high quality, perfect type & amount of breading, and a nice sauce).  The french onion soup was good.  Steak was great.  Asparagus with hollindaise was good.  Mashed potatoes were great.  Ceasar salad was great.  Creme brulee was amazing.\n\nHowever, the ambiance was not what we have come to expect from high end steakhouses like this...the entire place is open (ie. not private), and the decor is dated.  Even the menus seemed cheap.  However, they are closing soon for 2 months for a remodel, so hopefully that will be fixed.  The service was great, but not amazing, like we would expect for a $300 dinner.  For example, after our dessert was cleared we waited about 20 minutes for the check.",

The waiter and staff were extremely sympathetic and delivered amazing service, even though they could clearly tell I wasn't having a good time. These people are true pros, their training, experience and expertise is rarely matched anywhere. I could hardly imagine a more \"sad\" couple customers they'd ever have to deal with than my friend & I. But they completely rose to the \"occasion\" and ended up having to essentially package up 98% of our large meals for later consumption (incredible Blackened Prime Rib). It's now 9 months later and I must go back to Seattle because my finger still isn't much better. I will be hoping to enjoy \"The Met\" this time, though, without the crisis of last time. And I have full confidence that they will deliver, as they ALWAYS DO, a great dining experience!",

The food was great but our server on that particular date of Easter Sunday was very condescending.  When our party of 4 wanted to share the bone in 40 oz steak, that's when we saw the change in his attitude.  It was a giant steak and we wanted to be able to try many other delicious side orders .  He no longer was engaging and when asked to get us a dipping sauce for our steak he replied, \"Really?\"   I don't think customers should explain their meal preference.  This was a special occasion and he made us feel unwelcome at this restaurant.  I'm am truly disappointed in our experience there.  A special occasion dinner has to have  the ambiance, great food and service for make this restaurant worth going to.   We have friends coming in this week to dine at this particular restaurant and I truly hope they will not get the  treatment we had.",

Our waiter really paid attention to our desires and the meal was top notch.

The waitress barely showed up after the introduction. She did bring me a birthday creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e,  but really it was almost as if it was required. She had a very nice personality at first, but then really didn't care about us for the rest of the meal and I found it annoying.  So I have to say that the service was absolutely lousy. Dressed up nice, but not very cordial and not very enjoyable. Fortunately, the food was excellent!  If you're fortunate enough you know someone there who is already an excellent server with personality and care, then this is a golden place. If not, just understand what you're getting into. Absolutely great food, with service that's kind of cold.",

For years my lunch routine was a bowl of clam chowder, the best in Seattle, a glass of wine and the Times sports page in the bar with either Diane or Penny waiting tables and charming patrons, most of us regulars. I had my bachelor party here and my retirement party here. And no matter what, I have always been treated like the only guy in the house. This place is every bit as good as any east coast, venerable old steak house. I know because I've eaten at many of them over the years.\nIt's not cheap but as they say, you get what you pay for. One last bit of advice; do not come to this place and order chicken. This is a steak house and beef is king.\nYears ago I wrote a headline for another steak place that sums it all up for us meat lovers.\n\"There you are on your death bed wishing you could have one last rice cake.\"\nThe Met is the best.",

The menu is unimaginative and definitely does not stand out in today's Seattle restaurant scene.  The interior needs to be updated - seems tired and not current.",

I would expect to take what was available without a reservation but this was not the case.  Has a very casual not at all classy atmosphere.  Most people looked like they just walked into Burger King.   This place must be coasting on its name which is not deserved.

I ordered the 18oz blackened prime rib. The flavor was very good but the dryness of a dish ordered rare was very apparent.

        "Content": "This was our second attempt at Metropolitan Grill.  The second try was worse than the first.   Our server, Diana, started out friendly, and while she saw to the tables around us who were seated after us first, we were okay with it,  but whe we wanted to split a meal, things changed in a hurry.  She questioned our decision making asking if we realized that the 8 oz filet was small.  I guess I assume an 8 oz filet is....well, 8 oz.  I have ordered one before.  We ordered an appetizer of onion rings.  She wanted to know if we wanted soup or salad and when we declined, she seemed more miffed.   Our bread came and was plopped down in a hurry.  After a good amount of time, and the people around us were eating their appetizers and salads we are wondering if she perhaps forgot our onion rings.  Soon, here comes the entree with no onion rings.  When asked about it, Diana says \"it is not my fault, it is the kitchen's fault\".  Frankly, assuming the kitchen forgot (I'm not convinced of this), it is the servers responsibility to follow up with them and remind them that her order of onion rings is not ready.  Halfway through the entree, finally the onion rings come.  The onion rings themselves were awesome.  Probably the best I have ever had.  The steak was good....slightly \"blue\" in the center when we ordered medium, but we were afraid to speak to Diane any more at this point, and let it slide.  We ordered horseradish sauce with the steak which never came.  Again, we were intimidated into not mentioning it.  Finally, as with our last experience here, the baked potato is pre made and reheated.  This makes for a hard, lumpy lukewarm baked potato.    Needless to say, we won't be returning.",

The taste was just not there as it looked like the steak lacked some of the marbling that I remembered from previous visit.  There were four of us and each got a different steak.  Just not impressed with the taste & portion size.

They are very professional, from the greeters, to the servers, to the wine personnel, etc...they truly know what they're doing and they don't rush you.  We all had steaks (one Wagu filet, and 3 filet mignons) and thought they were about a 7 out of 10.  Two of the filets were 8 oz, and were cut pretty thin which was disappointing (it appeared that they cut the larger 13 oz steak in half horizontally).  The Wagu filet was really tender but also not quite as good as expected.  The salads and various potatoes we got were very good, and the chocolate lava cake we had for dessert was very good, but didn't have a scoop of vanilla ice cream (thought that was a little odd).\n\nAll in all, the Met is a good spot for a business dinner or to take friends too if they want to eat downtown, and you have the budget for it.  Next time we'll order something other than the filets and see if that makes a difference.",

The hostess immediately said \"your reservation is for 6 not 9, I can't help you\". Understanding that it was my problem not hers, that the party increased, I asked if there was any other options that she could offer, she said \"No, you can try someplace else\". I was so very disappointed, not so much in the fact that they could not accommodate me, but in how she responded and handled the situation. We ended up sitting our clients (7 of them) at a table and My boss and I ended up eating in the bar (waiting for our clients to finish dinner so that we could pay for it).

Every time we are treated like we are the only ones there. Our server this time was Lance. He took the time to answer all our questions with a smile and was very informative. \nHighly recommend the peppercorn steak. Fabulous!\nOther foods ordered\nSwordfish w/lemon caper sauce, 10oz Filet mignon,  sides of mashed potato, scalloped potato and asparagus.\nDessert Pear bread pudding. ;-) yum!\nNo one left disappointed.\nThank you Metropolitan Grill for always being the place we want to go to for the dinner of the year.",

Restaurants of this quality must never have an off night and to my knowledge they never have, certainly as far as my experience goes. The other biggies in Seattle have all let us down at one time or another. We will come back to the Met again and again. I had let it be known to The Met that this night was special for my wife, dear friend and me. I can't believe how they cared for us, making us feel like we were the only ones there. They brought us special appetizers, fussed over our wine selection, fabulous menu recommendations that we absolutely could not refuse and of course a complimentary dessert in honor of the occasion accompanied by a wonderful dessert wine; all on them. We had requested to be seated in Bruno's section and we were. Bruno is the absolutely the best! Matr'D Craig stopped by to say hi (I suspect it was he that ordered up all the special things for us). I asked, of Craig, a very special and secret favor for a future date  and he had Aaron, head of wines at The Met stop by to see if he could accommodate my special request. We have a future date for that; I am so honored that they will look after me in this manner. What a wonderful evening; fabulous treatment, equally fabulous food and wine. I only wish I could dine there every week!",

For appetizers, we ordered crab cakes and lobster bisque.  Both were perfect-- great flavor, texture and temperature.  However, 5 minutes into enjoying our appetizers, another server comes to our table and served us our our main course. We both ordered medium rare NY Strip Loin.  We were both stunned because we were not yet even halfway through our appetizers.  I thought to myself, 'am I being rushed?'  Our server was still attending to his other tables so we decided to wait until he checks on us again.  Once he came to our table, the steak was already cold since it has sat there on the side for more than 10 minutes while we finished our appetizers.  We told him what happened and he brought the steaks back to the kitchen.  Sadly, both steaks were just re-plated and I assume was probably reheated or blasted in the salamander.  My friend who has dined with you for years said that she was shocked that the chef did not fire new steaks on the grill.  It was truly disappointing since it felt like I was eating leftover steak that was cooked the night before.  I think our server tried to make things right but honestly, the entire experience for me was just ruined. It was my first time to dine with you, and of all days, on Christmas Eve.  My friend and I left with such an underwhelming feeling.  We paid $150 for both steaks that was comparable to a $20 steak from Applebee's.  Maybe I'll come back for dinner next time but it'll take a while to be convinced that it's worth trying The Met Grill for a second time.",

The lobster bisque was velvety smooth and the filet mignon and strip sirloin were done to perfection.

I ordered French Onion soup which should have been left in the oven longer.  The cheese is supposed to be crusty but mine was soft and just melted and soup itself was just warm.  Our steaks were properly cooked but also just warm when brought to the table and the au jus the waiter brought to pour over the steak was luke warm which made the steak even cooler.  We ordered a side of mushrooms and like everything else....just warm.   I was so wanting something hot that I ordered an after dinner Spanish coffee and even asked that it be hot when it arrives.  The waiter did bring me a nice and hot Spanish coffee.....in a glass ....that was too hot to pick up.  I then flagged down a \"Suit\" and asked it my coffee could be served in a cup or glass with a handle so that I could enjoy it while it was hot.  We get to Seattle a couple times a year and always make it a point to dine at the Met.  I think next time we will expand our horizons as there are many good high end steak houses in Seattle.",

Also, the french fries were way overcooked and only slightly warm and rubbery. Our waiter never returned to our table to ask how our meal was so we ate it ... like I said it was still good (we didn't eat the fries and only half the calamari.) When the bus boy came to clear he asked if we wanted to keep the fries so we told him of our dissappointment, but he just said that was a shame and then took our coffee & latte order.  The coffees never came. The bill quickly arrived on the corner of the table so we checked to make sure we weren't charged for the coffee which we were not. So we paid and left. It was still good, but not good enough to recommend considering the price.",

        "Content": "Something has happened to the Metropolitan Grill. Having eaten there many times in the past, I have never had a problem with them accommodating my wife's garlic allergy. Not so this time. Essentially nothing on the menu was made without garlic. They had Fettuccine Alfredo with Crab on the menu.  When I asked about it, the waiter, who was exceptional, came back and said the kitchen staff told him that there was garlic in the Fettuccine Alfredo. Fettuccine Alfredo should never be made with garlic, and especially when it is being served with fresh crab, as the garlic will overwhelm everything. When I asked if they could make it without garlic, the waiter was told no by the kitchen staff. I was somewhat shocked, as Alfredo sauce only has three ingredients and any marginally competent diner cook could make Alfredo sauce in about five minutes. After my suggesting, somewhat sarcastically,  to the waiter that he tell the chef that I could come back and make it for him, the chef then said he could do so. Why he did not just agree to make it in the first place I will never understand. Again, the waiter was outstanding in advocating for us, so I want to make it clear this is not a comment about the service, but is rather about the kitchen staff.  The service was outstanding. But this is one restaurant that has now been crossed off my list of places to dine, because if they put garlic in everything, they either lack creativity in the kitchen or they are trying to cover up for some second quality ingredients.  There are too many other outstanding restaurants to enjoy in Seattle without having to put up with this lack of flexibility by the kitchen staff.  So goodbye Metropolitan Grill. Next time I will go to El Gaucho or the Brooklyn.",

The filet was perfectly cooked and very tasty and the mashed potatoes were very good!  My meal however was not so good.  The steamed vegetables were hard and undercooked. The steak was just a bad cut of meat.  Tendon or something right through the middle.  It was prepared as I ordered it but was extremely tough and chewy.  I was very disappointed. I must say though, the restaurant treated us well and asked if they could cook another steak for me,. I declined though due to time. These things happen I know and we have been to the Met Grill many times in the past and never a bad meal.  I just wish it had not happened on such a special night.   :0(",

Since steaks are the specialty we knew we needed a nice bottle of wine and requested the Sommelier to come by. He was friendly, very knowledgeable and honored our request for a hearty Washington red - his choice was perfect as were our steaks. We split my enormous baked potato and shared (and loved) the side of root vegetables which we normally don't care for. For dessert we indulge in the mountainous chocolate layer cake with vanilla ice cream - dense, super moist, and amazing! We'd watch two adjacent tables have bananas foster prepared table-side with great flames and flare - reports were that it was delicious and portions plentiful! There was even a wedding proposal (and acceptance) at the adjacent booth. Two glasses of 20-year old port and FOUR hours later we rolled out of the Metropolitan Grill beyond satisfied and happy!

The food (Joe's Scramble) seemed prepared well in advance and was not the usual Met quality. A person in our party ordered a drink after the food came and it never showed up and he finally cancelled it as we had to leave.\nFor the prices they charge I expect everything to be very high quality and these last two occasions they definitely were not.",

I love the fact we got sides included with our entree. Not many places do that anymore. Best steak I have ever had in my life. I will come back and next time get the even more premium cut sampler plate. Drinks were strong and bold and fairly priced as well. The customer service was superb and unrivaled. The attention we received was the perfect amount and professional. Our server was busy with several tables but you never would have known. Very knowledgeable as well. Many good recommendations were given and none failed to deliver. 10/10, this is a must visit.",

        "Content": "Went here for my dad's 72nd birthday. You better be a steak connoisseur or you will not appreciate it. I'm not one, so my review is probably biased.  They sell you on committing to the high price of their steaks by trying to impress you, telling you \"facts\" and terms you didn't know  nor really matter in the end to show you they are the best steakhouse in town. While the steak was delicious, I could've gone to Safeway, bought the same cut, cooked it the same, and it would've tasted the same...  at a mere fraction of the price. A 8oz fillet mignon costed me $72 and I wanted to break out the scale. It was definitely closer to 6oz. I went with adding king crab for $38. I got 3 crab legs... uh, what?  Plus the entrees don't come with salad. So that was another $15 or so for a wedge. If this wasn't a special occasion I would have complained directly to the restaurant about bang for buck. Otherwise the service was great besides the awkward \"trying too hard\" aspect that I assume is part of their way to not have you feel ripped off at the end of the night. I'm sure this review sounds super negative. They do well at what they're best at I just felt like most of the experience was an overpriced facade.",

The other server that was serving the other guests, I wish we had him as our server. The service was slow. We didn't get bread and drinks as fast as you normally could. It's understandable, I use to work in the restaurant business myself. I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare. I didn't expect it to be that chewy. Normally it should melt in your mouth, not much effort to chew but I was chewing like a steak that's well done.

The service from our waiter was minimal to say the least, and my wife was super excited to see a desert menu...however they brought out a lemon tart or something..it was delicious but we never got to look at and order what we want. It was their way of surprising us (they knew it was our anniversary) but really was inconsiderate considering we would have liked to order our own deserts.  People were dressed mostly casual, it was definitely a comfortable atmosphere.

I had the Kurobota bacon-wrapped filet medallions with bleu cheese, and my husband had the large Angus filet. Both were excellent. I tried a new seasonal salad that needed some work, though. The grilled peach salad was a great idea, but could have been better executed: the peaches were underripe and hard, and the tiny amount of grilling wasn't enough to soften them up or add much flavor. The burrata cheese was tasty, but just kind of lay there in a lump. Frisee greens were fresh and the dressing uninspired. With fabulous local peaches still in stores, there's no excuse for using hard, underripe fruit. Interesting idea, but needed better planning.",

We always like to compare other steakhouses to our favorite, Ruth's Chris.  With that being said, we enjoyed the Met, but as far as the filet, Ruth's still remains on top for us.\n\nFor a Monday evening, the Met was a happening place.  Wonderful decor and a great wine list greeted us.  We certainly enjoyed the warm bread that was promptly served, but my field greens salad, although loaded with pears, Gorgonzola and candied walnuts, was overdressed in a not so tasty dressing.  John's French onion soup was flavorful and beefy.  When our entrees arrived, we couldn't wait to cut into our succulent fillets.  I enjoyed mine, but didn't experience that \"wow\" factor.  My husband's steak was served medium rare instead of the medium he was expecting.  His slice was also a bit fatty, which was surprising for such a top notch cut of beef.  Again, no \"wow\" factor.\n\nA nice perk, however, was that each entree came with one side.  Our choices,  mashed potatoes and roasted veggies, were plentiful and delicious.  An au jus gravy was also served by the waiter after our entrees were presented.\n\nThe highlight of our meal was one of our favorite desserts--cherries jubilee.  Done table side,  the scrumptious cherries were served over some of the best vanilla ice cream we have ever had.  Wow!\n\nService here was great and the dinner moved along nicely.  We were well taken care of.\n\nAlthough we wouldn't rate the Met as high as Ruth's Chris, we did enjoy our meal.",

And the sides were so unique and delicious that every bite made me smile. And the salads and bread and  wine again were perfect....every time.  It was very expensive but always  worth it...but not this time.  This  time everything  was 100%  mediocre.  And it cost us $250.00.  The New York Strip was completely unremarkable.  The massive pile of roasted root vegetables was mushy  and  tasteless  and  the wedge salad had too much dressing.  The bread was even boring.  Our server was very nice.  And the ambiance was great as always.  But the food made me sad.  Now we have to find a  new fine dining restaurant.",

We were going out for a special occasion and had noted that on our reservation. Our server at the end of the meal did ask if we were celebrating something and then did bring us a complimentary dessert, but in the past notes like that had been passed along and somehow the servers made the whole dining experience that much more special.  The atmosphere was also really loud, which could have been because there was a Guns N Roses concert and people were pre-partying before the show.  The food was good, but for the price it just didn't wow us.  The mac & cheese was dry and for Wagu beef I expected something more.  Overall it was more of an average experience, not that special night out we were looking for.",

Service was helpful but somewhat abrupt. We were not allowed to order our appetizers while we were still thinking about dinner. \n\nThe waiter was funny, and very quick with the cocktails when we ordered, but brought the wrong garnish for me. I asked where the olives were and he was puzzled, so I pointed it out on the menu again and he quickly corrected it. No big deal. The martini was good, but unfortunately the olives were not firm like I hoped. \n\nThe  steaks we ordered and our salads and everything else was quite good. The steaks were larger than other fancy steakhouses charging similar prices so you get a good deal. However given the ambiance (crowded, many casually dressed patrons, loud and busy), we found it to not be worth it in the end. We felt we could have gone to el Gaucho, spent about the same or less and been more blown away with the flavors (albeit with smaller steaks but still a large meal).\n\nI think if they did something about the atmosphere or lowered prices I would be more interested in dining here again. For the money, you can get a better meal somewhere else.",

Good thing, he chose a different beer which he really liked.  I had a gin and tonic, it was so, so.  The tonic was a little flat.  When our table was ready, it was a smooth transition to the table.  I did not want a huge steak so the server suggested a 4 oz option - just right for me.  It was the Waygu beef and very tender.  My husband had the Delmonico.  They were so different from each other!  And we were glad to ask the sommelier a suggestion for the wine because we had no idea how different the steaks would be.  We split a salad -which was plenty for both of us.  And had the mushrooms as a side which contained a variety of mushrooms and a great addition.  We were not rushed at all - hence the reason our table was not available when we arrived.

My team had a visiting Legacy banker in from Boston and we took him over for lunch. I ordered the steak frites, with a side of ranch for the fries, and asked for my steak to be cooked medium-well/well. When our meal came, my steak was more on the rare side then I prefer. I politely asked our waiter to cook the steak a little longer and encouraged my dining companions to start on their halibut. When my steak was returned, it was done so without any comment or apology and no sauce for the fries. Mildly frustrating but not a major concern. I figured I would ask our sever for some sauce when he returned to fill our drinks, but he never did. We didn't see another staff member until a runner came to pre-bus our table and boxed up the remainder of my steak. Our waiter did come back to present the check and that was the last we saw him. I dine there enough to expect the exemplary service I normally receive. Unfortunately for our guest from Boston, this wasn't a stellar first impression.",

We loved the wedge salad which is enormous, but a perfect split.  We adored the house rib-eye steak, again split (for $6 extra but that includes two substantial sides per person), and we were treated to a special occasion dessert which was delightful (creme brulee).\n\nThe drinks are expensive but again, the portions are generous.

He said \"oysters, porcini, shitake\" so we ordered it. When it came, it was half crimini, a few shitakes, chanterelles, and enokitakes. I didn't know what the enokitakes were, so I asked. He told me oysters. I disagreed, so he took a sample back to the kitchen, and came back saying 3 people in the kitchen also identified them as oysters. I am a forager, and know how to positively identify oysters. I got a half-hearted apology and eventually the floor manager came out with a print out identifying them as enokitakes, and explained that the mix of \"wild mushrooms\" changes all the time. I would expect the wait staff to know that, especially their Friday-night staff. Instead of saying that, he made up some ingredients. Also, if the kitchen staff can't ID the mushroom they handle, that is also concerning to me. And to top it off, they didn't even take the mushrooms off our bill. So this establishment lost quite a bit of luster in my eyes over this visit.",

We were told in a few minutes, and a few became almost 20.  They put us in a private room which was nice.  Our waiter was helpful, and pleasant but at times he disappeared and no other help was visible.  It would have been nice to have him or someone else check on the room more often.

Unfortunately, today's lunch did not meet the basic expectations one would receive from a basic sit down diner. \n\nFor an iconic Seattle steak restaurant how can you not have a basic baked potato with a steak if a customer requests it for lunch or dinner?  We were told by the manager that it takes 1.5 hrs to bake a potato and that was not part of the menu. I've had lunch at the Met and have had a bake potato in the past. Why was this not on the menu for Mothers Day?  \n\n The manager today was really disappointing. Took him over 20 minutes to come to our table when we requested to speak with him when so many things were going wrong with the experience. We asked the waiter and other staff where he was and they all rolled their eyes and said he was in his \"office\". When he came out instead of taking responsibility all he had were excuses after excuses. That to me is unacceptable and not good customer service. Now I understand why the restaurant was half empty when most 4 to 5 star restaurants are booked solid on Mothers Day. \n\nI don't think I will ever recommend or dine at the Met ever again. Instead of having a great Mothers Day lunch we left with our heads shaking and wondering what happened to this once great Seattle steak house.",

I made a reservation almost 1 month in advance.  1)The first table we were given was right on top of people seated in the bar area.  We asked fro a new table\n2)  Our main course was served before we finished our salad- talk about feeling rushed.\n3)  I ordered my steak medium, it was under cooked\n4) After waiting for our waiter to return so I could send it back, I finally tracked down another waiter for help\n5) Steak was cooked more and when it was returned, it was too well done.\n6) My potato was lukewarm and the cheese sauce was lukewarm and very bland.\n\n$160+ later- I was extremely disappointed with the entire experience.  To add insult to injury, I call the restaurant the next day to complain. The receptionist said manager was busy  but she  would connect me with her voicemail.  i received a recording asking me to spell the person's alst name which I did not know.  I had to hang up and call back again.  I  left a message directly with the receptionist for the manager and was told I would receive a return call.  That was 2 days ago and I have never been contacted.\n\nThere is no comparison to how this restaurant used to be. There are sooooo many other choices for restaurants and I am very frustrated that I wasted a celebration and special evening with my son at this restaurant.",

We had so much anticipation of having this amazing dining experience, but upon being seated we had to wait awhile for our waiter to introduce himself to us and then once he took our drink order, he vanished for what seemed to be a long time for just a water and a mixed drink.  We didn't order an appetizer but did order a soup and salad and there again it seemed like a long time for that to arrive.  Our main course finally arrived, and while it was tasty, we sadly found flaws...I ordered the small filet mignon (med well) and my spouse order the cajun prime rib (med rare).  My filet was blood red in the middle and his was barely pink!! We were disappointed but left a nice tip because our waiter was trying hard, but spent more time telling stories, trying to please us I guess.  We came here as a special occasion, we live in Poulsbo and rarely make it to the city, and thought that the Met Grill would be the place to go for such an occasion.  I'm sorry to say that we were disappointed...we had hoped for so much more!!",

It was interesting to note that the majority of patrons in this large restaurant were men; we were there mid-week celebrating our anniversary, so maybe we caught an afterwork crowd. The french onion soup was \"okay,\" a lot of bread under the cheese in the broth fairly overwhelmed the soup. The claim chowder was also \"okay\" not superior, but fine for a starter dish.

        "Content": "I love Metropolitan Grill and we visit several times a year. It's our go-to special occasion/celebration restaurant. On this visit, though, I was extremely disappointed in the changes to the recipe for one of their classic cocktails, the Smoky Met Martini. I don't drink a lot of cocktails that aren't sweet, but the Smoky Met Martini has always been one of my faves, Ketel One Vodka with a splash of scotch and an orange twist, ideally shaken and poured tableside. Well, the shaken/poured tableside part has fallen by the wayside, and I can live with that, but the recent change to the recipe is another story. I checked the menu before ordering and was surprised to find that the Smoky Met Martini is now a completely different cocktail, with the change to Laphroaig single malt scotch and smoked olives!!? How does this cocktail still have the same name?\n\nHaving faith in the Met (and never having tasted Laphroaig), I ordered the new Smoky Met, requesting the substitution of an orange twist for the olives. Oh, aarrggghhh! It's completely different. Instead of the smoky-sweet hint of scotch at the back of the vodka, accented by the tang of orange from the twist, the new Smoky Met slammed my nose and mouth with a blast of formaldehyde and old socks. The twist was lost in the onslaught, buried under Laphroaig funk.  Okay, I admit I haven't found a single malt I'm really wild about, but Laphraoig is so not it. I drank it, partly because it's freakin' expensive and partly because I hoped I'd acclimate to the taste. No such luck. \n\nI won't say the change in the cocktail ruined the (otherwise great) meal for me, but I'd pleasantly anticipated that cocktail and was sorely disappointed to find it changed for the much worse. I won't order it again, and I hope that in future if the Met decides to change up a cocktail recipe, they give the resulting abomination a different name.",

Incidentally, not being from the west, my wife ordered the same dish at Ray's the night after and it was outstanding, night and day to the Metropolitan.

I wouldn't say it was dead quiet but the noise didn't bother or disturb us at all and we could talk at normal voice levels and hear each other just fine without being isolated in some private corner. \n\nNo complaints! \n\nThank you for a great night and delicious food! \n\nWe will be back for my birthday soon!",

Kind of shocking, actually. She was super slammed, with two giant groups in her section, and it was the Feb coupon season so extra busy, but dang. So grumpy. When a person repeated their drink order, she was super abrupt about saying, \"I know already!\" And then she ended up forgetting two things, including one of the drinks. She did comp a dessert because of the missed salad, which was a classy move. Although it was a bday celebration and normally there's a comped creme brulee and that somehow got missed. But the birthday girl got her chocolate lava cake comped because her salad never arrived, so it all worked out in the end. I mean, we still had a gorgeous meal and a nice evening celebrating. And everyone can have an \"off\" night. I empathized with her having to deal with the two large groups (and how the kitchen managed to send 12+ entrees at once is a testament to The Met, for sure!).

We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation and we're seated promptly at exactly our reservation time. We were seated in a very comfortable booth and our server introduced himself immediately and offered us drinks.\n\nMy partner ordered wine and I had a Manhattan, which was superb. We ordered the crab cakes and we were so surprised to receive three large crab cakes that were delicious! For dinner, my partner ordered the American Waygu skirt steak and she loved it so much. She let me try a piece and, I must say, I was very jealous. It was so well seasoned and tender - it was fantastic. Our server compared it to an upscale carne asada and we agreed wholeheartedly. For me, I ordered the American Waygu New York Strip and it was top notch. Served medium rare, lightly seasoned, and cut like butter. Our sides included a baked potato, garlic mashed potatoes, and we shared the Lobster Mac n' Cheese. All three were home runs, especially the Mac n' Cheese!\n\nFinally, we shared the carrot cake for dessert and it was one of the best I've ever had. Moist cake with creamy icing and two scoops of Bourbon ice cream on the side. It put the final touch on an already stellar dinner.\n\nOur server, Nick, was a consummate professional. He served us quickly and kindly and even went out of his way to write down other Seattle hotspots for us to check out (we're new in town). Overall, this was a 5-star experience and worth every penny.",

The line was minimal, and we were actually seated early (much to my delight).  The dinner was divine (three Oscar style Filet Mignon, and one blackened Prime Rib).  So much so, that my youngest son declared the Filet Mignon the best he's ever tasted.  That's something - for he has tried Filet Mignon at Ruth Chris, El Gaucho and countless other restaurants in the U.S.  Free 9-layer chocolate cake was a nice treat from the Met, and greatly appreciated.

The tableside service of the chateaubriand and the hot apple pie were wonderful and both items were delicious!  Don't let them fool you though - they claim the apple pie feeds two...it actually can easily feed 4!",

        "Content": "New Years' Eve was the second time I ate here. The first time, I was impressed with their service and steaks, potatoes, and cocktail drinks, although it's all very pricey. The second time I was much less impressed. I ordered a $59 8 oz Filet Mignon very well done (no pink), and asked to share it with my fiance. They wanted to charge $6 extra to give us an extra plate with an additional side. We didn't want the extra side, just the plate, but they claimed they don't do that. The steak arrived on a single plate. The waitress gave us an extra bread plate, but that small thing wasn't the right solution for a place this pricey. Strike one.\n\nWe discovered the steak was quite pink inside and sent it back. No big deal. They let us keep the baked potato, which was excellent. However, when the steak came back it was *still* pink inside. I do not think it was cooked more at all. I suspect they have one of those chefs who believes steak must be served pink, but that isn't the way I ordered it! Strike two.\n\nThe waitress offered to bring us completely new meals, starting over. That would be fine; however, she took away our baked potato without asking. There's no reason for us not to finish the side while we waited for the new plates to arrive. Strike three, you're out.\n\nIt was then an hour since we arrived, and we had a deadline so we decided we couldn't wait for the new steak and we would just pay for the two cocktails we'd had and go. One bright spot: the waitress said the cocktails were on them. However, we were not given an opportunity to discuss the situation with the manager before we left, which is customary in these high-end places. Strike...four?\n\nAlso, my margarita was not served in a margarita glass, just a standard glass. A minor thing but on top of the rest it's worth mentioning.\n\nA day or two later I developed a sore throat. I can't say for sure if it's related to eating here, but I also can't rule it out.",

We were nicely dressed, but don't exactly fit the profile of their usual 1 percenter clientele. They seated us in a corner booth at the far end of the restaurant. We ordered a bottle of champagne and a few appetizers to start. The waiter played the jovial entertainer/host in addition to helping us select food and taking orders. I apparently annoyed a wine steward because I wanted the group to decide on their entre orders BEFORE we chose a wine. He didn't come back to our table, the waiter got another steward to come over about 20 minutes later. I selected a wine from the list, but they were out and substituted a more expensive bottle at the same price, which was very good. Kudos for that. The bottle arrived just as the entres were coming.  My steak, which was a nice medium rare, was excellent quality, but arrived a bit cold, which was the only demerit with the food itself. They gave us a huge slice of cake at the end of the evening in honor of the happy couple. \nOverall, the service is attentive, the food is excellent quality, and the atmosphere is classy. The negatives are that the prices are ridiculous and the 'classy' thing can easily tip over into a subtle undercurrent of snobbery, to which no one should ever be subjected when they're paying those prices.",

The 12 oz prime rib was excellent by the way! We did not have drinks so I can't really speak to the price or quality of the wine menu. We did finish the meal with carrot cake. I will tell you order only one as it was enough fro three people. It came with vanilla ice cream and was delicious. Overall very nice. If you have the means, I recommend that you give this place a go at least once. You will not be disappointed. Did I mention they have a 34 oz steak!",

Had the Fennel salad- what a misnomer- if you tell me its a fennel salad I expect fennel to be a feature- there were so many other flavors going on it was hard to tell if there was even fennel in it- The salad was good- it just wasn't a fennel salad.\nDecided to go all out on the steak and had the three 4 Oz fillets including the high end wagyu- 12oz of steak for a $125 list price- I expected excellence- what I got was mediocrity- the high end cut was overpriced hiding the expected flavor- the cook was medium rare- I ordered rare.\nDessert was ridiculous- ordered the carrot cake- it was good but the portion was way too large- was the fact that they brought me such. A large portion meant to impress me- it didn't.\nOn the plus side, the martini was excellent- served with panache! The wine by the glass was OK- overpriced and probably not from a recently opened bottle, but OK\nOverall if you want a high quality dining experience, don't go to the Metropolitan Grill- there are better places to spend a lot of money for food!",

He was hilarious and filled with the history of The Met which was very intriguing. Our food was out of this world. I had the King Salmon and my husband had the filet. We enjoyed the entire night and all of the staff, Charles too, were wonderful.",

Both were delicious and perfectly cooked and the portions were very large.  Nice cocktails and a comprehensive wine list. All in all a great experience (except for being a Bears fan).",

He is charming, knowledgeable, very professional, but also very personable without being fake.  \n\nAs a dinner I am very observant of service, and my wife would be quick to tell you that I can be very critical at times.  From my three trips to The Met I have seen and heard nothing but excellent service from each and every staff member.  The experience for me is always exceptional.\n\nDinners should note that The Met is a very Seattle institution; you should expect to see families and casually dressed people.  This is not the stuffier, dimly lit, cigar room experience of other steak houses.  Nor is this a super hip dinning destination where all the wait staff is comprised of attractive 20 somethings. The Met is a place for friends, for family, and for great steak.\n\nList of Steaks I've Had at the Met:\n1. Bone in Rib Eye\n2. New York Strip\n3. Long Bone Rip Eye (a.k.a 40 ounces of love).

They also provided me any desert I wanted without charge, so we got the seven layer chocolate cake - Yum!\n\nThis is a wonderful special occasion restaurant that does an outstanding job with both food and service.  We'll be back and we highly recommend it.",

Wrapped up and into the James ST terminal in 6min. Highly recommend as a preflight meal before heading to SEATAC.",

I will definitely agree that the steak selection is probably the most impressive I've ever seen, as is the wine list. They are not cheap, but I think one expects that from this establishment.\nWe started with the baked Brie, which was delicious! \nThen we decided to share the New York strip for 2, prepared tableside. Both the waiter and server raved it was their favorite steak on the menu, and that is saying something considering the prices for some of the other choices were upwards of $200.00\nIt was cooked perfectly and plated beautifully. (Be prepared to wait 30-40 minutes after you order)\nNow for the part you really want to hear,,,,,,, it was good,,,,, but it was just good. The roasted root veggies were delicious and the Brussel sprouts were fair. I honesty make better tasting steaks myself. After everything I heard and looking at the menu and the decor in here, I expected amazing, mind blowing, melt in your mouth highly flavorful steak. But it was just good. \nWe also had the apple pie prepared tableside. Again, very fun, very dramatic (it's enough to feed 4!) but just good. It's very very sweet. Best part was the ice cream. That was wonderful!\nAll in all a lovely place. Feels very old vegas. Service was impeccable. Really first rate. A fun night out and worth it to go at least once.",

We also shared asparagus at our table with a light cheese sauce. Delicious! We each had bake potatoes that were huge & cooked to perfection. It also came with a cheese sauce that paired well with the potatoe. It was my birthday, so we finished with complimentary creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Crispy on top & creamy in the center. Perfection!",

The place is always packed and you need a reservation, maybe you can eat at the bar without one.  Good cocktails and wine list.\nIt seems the food is slipping a bit because of the volume they have to crank out every night.  Had a filet and wagu to compare taste and thought wagu didn't justify upcharge---be careful because they want to pour au jou over your meat at the table which really distorts the taste.  The scalloped potato side looked like it had been sitting in a sheet pan too long as the cheese on top was not hot.\nBrussels sprouts were good.  Service was hurried and not particularly friendly (forgot his name);  which is a change from prior visits.\nKevin did his masterful job of tableside bananas foster, always a treat for first time guests......he definitely has put in his 10,000 hours!

The wine selection is literally a novel that is easy to navigate with the largest selection I have ever seen (we've seen a lot as we live in Sonoma Co.) and the mixed drinks had a perfect balance of ingredients. cocktails run from $8.00-14.00, beer $5-14, and wine was all over the map. Everything we put into our mouth was amazing from deep fried artichoke hearts, wild mushroom mix, peach salad, crab cakes (best I have ever had hands down), and finally the Prime Rib! The Prime Rib was simply phenomenal all the way around from the presentation to the taste! Thanks you Bruno for making our night so special.\n\n-Q&J \nSonoma County, California",

Hooray! \n\nWe typically can't afford to go to a place like The Met often, so this was a special treat. We were 15 minutes early for our reservation but were greeted warmly by the hostesses and seated immediately which was nice. However, we sat for at least 5 minutes before being greeted. When our server arrived, she informed us that she had just got out of a shift meeting among the staff. No worries though, she was polite and apologetic. \n\nWe ordered a round of cocktails, my wife ordered a 'Light and Lovely' and I, Woodford Reserve Bourbon on the rocks. Delish!Seeley, could tell we were in no rush and graciously obliged us. \nAfter finishing our drinks we ordered. We started with the crab cakes. We were pleasantly surprised to see that this was a generous portion of crab cakes, 3 in all. The crab cakes were well seared and settled in a butter sauce and cabbage slaw. They were good, but light on crab meat. They were filled with stuffing and even vegetables. Who knew carrots were in crab cakes?\n\nFor our next course we ordered Lobster Bisque. This was perhaps our biggest disappointment. In both our bowls, not one tangible piece or lobster. And to make matters worse, there was a gargantuan amount of creme fraiche and chives garnished on top. My wife hates chives and we did not know they would be served on the bisque. I know most garnishes aren't listed on the menu, but this was too much. It skewed the entire bisque. So thumbs down on the bisque. \n\nFor our entrees, my wife ordered prime rib (MR) and I had the Ribeye (MR). My wife's prime rib was outstanding! Best we've ever had! But unfortunately, instead of receiving a ribeye like I ordered, I received a New York Strip. It was cooked to perfectly MR so I didn't complain. After all, we were out to celebrate my wife's health. The Strip Steak was average for a top tier restaurant.",

It would be more reasonable at $20 - $25 given the fact that it's not even one whole crab leg.  \n\nThe cherries jubilee is fantastic!  At $22 it's reasonably priced as 4 people can easily share it, and it's made at your table.  \n\nOn our next visit we most likely will try another restaurant, but if you want a well prepared steak with great service, you should try it as the food is very good.",

We were not in the mood to stuff ourselves, and waste too much $$ on doggie bags that we couldnt/wouldnt take to the stadium.  The astute black-tie waiter recommended splitting the Chateaubriand 3-ways--which turned out to be 4-ways...and we each had a cocktail (not for the 14 y o) salad and appetizer.  It was perfect, delicious, and there was none of the \"oh, another cheapskate family in soccer jerseys\"--our waiter sincerely wanted us to have the best experience and made us feel that we made the perfect choice.  The filet melted in our mouths, and my 14 yo was the most impressed...(\"Dad, if we lived here, this is where I would want to have my birthday meal every year!\").  With drinks, and tip we were in the mid-300s....but the experience was one of a lifetime for my visiting family, and worth every penny.\n\nThis is my 4th time in 27 years to go to the Metropolitan Grill...each visit has a story and a memory of near-perfect service and food quality.  It is my favorite of many fantastic steakhouse grills that I have visited around the world.  Even a casual visit to the bar--it feels like what \"Cheers\" was in the 80s--a local brass rail sports bar on one side and upscale black-tie service dining on the other.   Perfect for the most important events, and also for the quick thirst-quenching stop to catch the game.  \n\nI never write reviews...but couldn't stop myself today.

Once the waitress found out we didn't want wine  or cocktails, she seemed uninterested in our table.  I ordered the 4 oz dry aged and 4 oz wagyu combo $64 to compare the meat.  Even though they were both ordered Medium, the dry aged was over cooked (medium well) and the wagyu was severely undercooked (medium rare)!  The strawberry shortcake, although big, it was very dry.   The food and service was not worth the unnecessary high price.  Will not be going back.",

        "Content": "First, the steaks are really good. The prime rib was also a lovely cut - tasty but a little on the dry side. The auju that was served on the side was delicious and helped the prime rib. We had good sized baked potatoes on the side - perfectly cooked with a surprisingly good cheese sauce along with the green onions and sour cream. We started out with the artichoke heart appetizer which was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend! Caesar salad was OK. I wish we had ordered the soup instead. Very nice menu selection though. We knew we liked Chateau St. Michele wine, so we decided to ask the restaurant wine expert which one he would recommend. There were 4 cabs on the wine list... Disappointing selection:( it was drinkable but not great. Next time I'll go with the most expensive and take my chances. The one he recommended was not bad but nothing special. Go with your gut.  There were very good expensive wines on the wine list - Silver Oak and Opus One - if you want to go in that direction. Dessert was the most disappointing part of the meal. Couldn't resist ordering the tableside bananas foster, and it was flavorless. The waiter seemed like he was in a hurry to be done, so the bananas were undercooked with a sauce that was lacking in flavor. I make it better at home. You can see it's a good restaurant, so maybe we hit it on the wrong day? We were celebrating a birthday (which was never acknowledged), and squeezed into a booth that was on the small side. I was expecting more. I'd probably give it another chance though. So only 4 stars. Our waiter actually tried but had to only give 3 stars because of his superiors lack of assistance.",

Metropolitan Grill was close and had some great reviews. \n\nTo sum up our evening, the Metropolitan Grill did Seattle proud...from the drinks, to the appetizers, to the Wagyu beef, to the Alaskan Copper River Salmon, and finally to the amazing Hot Apple Pie dessert, it was a fantastic experience. What greatly added to our enjoyment was our waiter, Bruno Stolz. To put it honestly, Bruno is the greatest waiter on the planet.  This is a guy that obviously loves what he is doing and wants his customers to have that same experience. He is as knowledgeable about his menu as anyone I've ever encountered and does a wonderful job of explaining the expansive options to the customer.  I appreciate good service and must say I've never been as impressed with anyone as much as Bruno. \n\nAs great as the service was, the food did not fail to deliver.

If you can afford to dine here regularly, then good for you. If you are able to come here once or twice a year like me, then you need to go hard when you do.  Expect to spend upwards of $500 for dinner for two and do NOT get squeamish when it come time to add the gratuity. The staff there is fantastic; extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and in no hurry whatsoever to turn your cover. They were gracious giving us time to parse the menu and then guide us through the extensive wine list. The half bottle we got with dinner jumped out to both of us when it was described and we were over the moon with the selection.\n\nThe Copper river salmon tartare appetizer was mouthwatering. It was served with pickled cucumber slices and a jellied wasabi that was insane.\n\nMy date had an 8oz Waygu tenderloin medium, which she loved. I was given a piece and while I usually steer away from tenderloin as I find it overrated as a cut, the Waygu (my first experience with it) was substantially more enjoyable than any other tenderloin I have eaten. My preference would be for another cut, so I would not order this, but my date was delighted with her selection.\n\nI had the dry aged Rib-Eye medium rare. Stupid good. Cooked to perfection... such a full mouth of flavor and tenderness. I worry I will never try anything else on the menu in the future because this is the finest steak I have ever had on the west coast (sorry, but Peter Luger in NYC is insane).\n\nWe each had mashed potatoes as a side and shared the cedar plank mushrooms for the table and both were outstanding companions to the meat.\n\nFor desert we did Apple pie for 2 withe table side prep. I know this presentation is kind of a hockey throwback but I honestly do not care how that confection gets to us as long as it arrives! Every component was mouthwatering and an excellent finish to this meal.",

My wife chose the french toast, scrambled eggs and bacon.  Our food arrived promptly..eggs looked like they'd been sitting in a container for hours, were overcooked and dry. Bacon resembled something you'd get on a burger from Safeco Field. Steak...well, it resembled something more like the tongue off my hunting boots, tough, little taste to the gravy. Potatoes were the best part of the meal. My wifes meal was the same. French Toast was average, no butter.

The crab cakes were blah and luke warm, the vegetable tower was the same. Of the steaks ordered at the  table only the double filet with bacon and blue cheese was outstanding. With so many new and great restaurants in Seattle, the Met Grill needs to up its game and not rest on its laurels.",

The food was great with the exception of the Cajun spiced prime rib.  The rosemary and other herbs that were used overpowered the prime rib meat flavor.  That piece of meat was not enjoyable by any of us.  It also looked as though the chef just dumped the seasonings onto the meat and it was not seasoned into the cooking of the meat.  That was the only disappointment. The filet's were fabulous.   The large cut of prime rib was great.  Service was fabulous. French onion soup was great.",

It was not possible to eat it as a sandwich so used knife and fork. The bun was large and dry and the slice of white cheese topping the steak was almost melted. There weren't many onions but the fries were plentiful and pretty good. I don't recall my sisters saying their lunches were good, but maybe that was because we were so busy gabbing. The server was very patient and accommodating. Service at the Met is always polished so I have no complaint in that area.",

Service is impeccable but not overbearing, nor stuffy at all.  Very, very attentive. Exceptional wine list. The prices are not for the meek at heart. It adds up quickly. Drinks, apps, salad, entr\u00e9e, dessert, wine, maybe after dinner drink; plan on at least $125/pp including tip. Can easily go higher than that with beef cuts and wine list.

I like how it's old school (clubby booths and staff dressed-up) but not pretentious; the night we were there, there was everything from very casual to dressed-to-the-nines for patrons. I like how we were Seattle casual (dark jeans, dress shoes, and nice sweaters), but we weren't treated any differently.\n\nMy husband and I do well, but we are very humble people and are often put-off by pretension that oozes at some Seattle restaurants; this is  a restaurant that realizes all customers are worth their time. For that alone (and, of course, the excellent dishes), we'll keep coming back.\n\nOn a final note, we each ordered a cup of the Lobster Bisque - it was creamy and flavorful. Husband's NY strip steak was cooked to perfection and my prime rib melted in my mouth like butter. We each loved our serving of homemade mashed potatoes and the waiter recommended a beer that actually suited my husband's taste.",

Dinner was absolutely divine and we appreciate the attention to detail from the moment we stepped in to your restuarant. \nThe portion sizes were large, salads were amazing, bread was delish and the steaks were cooked to perfection. I loved the roasted root vegetables I had with my steak. The cheesecake and chocolate decadence was a cherry on top and a wonderful suprise from our server to celebrate our night out. Loved the atmosphere, the classic music, the plush velvet booth, and especially our warm and friendly server Michael who was an absolute gem.  We will be back.",

Mine was so rare in the middle that I couldn't even eat it all.  \n\nFor those of you that can deal with a rare steak this would be no big deal.

My only slight issues was that early on a glass of water was spilled on my husband accidentally by the waitstaff and although there were numerous apologies and a visit from the manager, it would have been a nice touch to be offered a free appetizer or dessert??  Also when I ordered the La Crema wine, I did not realize they also made one from Willamette.  I was brought that particular bottle, which happened to be $18 more than the Sonoma variety??

This is a business and they've got better things to do that ensure that you are comfortable and well taken care of.\n\nThat said, the beef is excellent and prepared exactly to order.

The salmon was excellent but the steak overlooked and not quite as tender as usual.   The French Onion soup is one of the best I've had anywhere but my Mom didn't even eat her salad because it was so soaked in dressing.  Our favorite part of the meal is usually the cherries jubilee, we order it every time, but this time it had no sauce at all.  It was ice cream with cherries and a thick paste and there wasn't more then a tablespoon of it.   Despite those errors, we would have walked away with a good experience if it wasn't for the service.  It started out well but after he delivered the entrees, our waiter disappeared for at least twenty minutes (I checked my phone) and my Mom and daughters thought it was closer to a half hour.  The only person we could find was the bus boy and he didn't speak English.  I was willing to go find him but I couldn't even see him and figured he went on a break.  I don't like to complain.  It's awkward and embarrassing and it was my daughters 18th birthday.  I didn't want it to go down that way.  I wanted to preserve the warm feelings we had going prior to the meal.

I highly recommend reservations because although when we showed up at 6:30 PM for ours it was not too packed, by the time we left at 7:45 PM it was jumping! Hardly a seat free in a large dining space.\n\nThere are some very nice touches such as the staff asking to take your coat and checking it for you and the service overall was attentive and well done. Between the two of us we shared the Lobster Bisque (one of the best bites we had for sure), the Ceaser salad, and then the dry aged ribeye. Everything was delicious and even though we split we were not able to finish everything. \n\nI feel that the pricing of the restaurant was great for the level of quality and service you get. Very expansive wine collection and for you beer drinkers out there they have a decent tap selection augmented by a nice list of custom bottles. There is of course a full bar as well with all the cocktail options available.\n\nWe had a great time and will certainly come back. Thanks for a lovely evening Metropolitan!",

        "Content": "This restaurant, a Seattle landmark, is desperately in need of a facelift.  The owners should visit Ray's Boathouse and get some tips.  Ray's, like Metropolitan was fading and in need of renovation and improvement on food quality.  Rays is now a great restaurant again, with good food and modern setting.   \n\nFirst, it did not help that we were seated at a table at the back of the restaurant, sandwiched in between the kitchen and a wait station and a boisterous family.  However, watching one of the waiters (actually, I think he was a water/clearer of table person in black apron) at the wait station vigorously pick his nose was, to say the least, not good for the appetite. \n\nSecond, while the steaks are pretty good, they are not great.  I had the prime filet of tenderloin and it was just ok.  Having just had a nice steak dinner at John Howie over Christmas, where the filet was nicely seasoned (and you did not even have to put the exotic selection of salt on), the Met was disappointing.  I have been to the Met many times over the years and it was great years ago, but I do believe that the food is now mass produced and the restaurant is resting on its laurels.\n\nPerhaps the owners should visit Texas and check out some good steak and come back with some innovative ideas.  There are better places in town to get steak at the Met prices (about $100 per person) and you can bet that is where I will be dining, until at some point, the Met brushes up.",

Also I know of one of the delicious special items they offer that are not on the menu and asked for it upon placing my reservation. I don't mention this special as there are few of these available an I want mine the next time I visit. \nService is bar none at this establishment no matter who your server is. \nTake advantage of the Chocolate Lava Cake no matter how full you are. The left overs travel well and I enjoy it for several more days.\nThe experience dining her is well worth the, I hate to say expense, investment it really worth it. I have eaten at most of the steak houses here in Seattle and other cities in the US including New York and the Met serves the most consistent top quality beef anywhere !",

We were welcomed and seated right away, maybe 5 minutes before our reservation time.\n\nIf memory serves, our waitress was Dianne.  She has worked there a long time, was very helpful with the menu and choices, and the perfect balance of being present and giving us privacy to talk and eat.\n\nWe shared a wedge salad to start, which was just the right size.  My wife had the prime rib with creamed spinach and I had a filet with the yukon gold potatoes.  Both steaks were very good...  hardly need the steak knife, and don't need the steak sauce.  I'm not a big spinach fan, but liked the creamed spinach and stole more of that than my wife did of my potatoes.  The potatoes were cooked well and I enjoyed them, but seemed like glorified hash browns.  We finished off with a chocolate lava cake, which was good, but chewier than we like (maybe more caramel than other restaurants).\n\nAll in all a very good dinner.  Prices are in the hiogher end of the \"fine steakhouse\" range, and didn't seem worth it, but dinner was good.",

Our sommelier was  pompous and condescending.  We've been around the wine block for many years and know our wines well, but this man was over the top.  The Met Grill did not have a bottle listed on the menu so the sommelier proposed another wine (same region and a similar blend).  It was opened and I tasted it, commenting that it wasn't as good at the Mark Ryan Dissident I was enjoying - this substitute was thin and it wasn't as enjoyable.  My husband said it would be OK so we drank the stuff.  Poor choice on our part.  This wine steward is not an asset to the Met Grill.  His performance and behavior detracted from our overall dining experience.  Too bad, because the rest of the staff is such a pleasure.",

We were excited at the possibility of seeing some local celebrities - we didn't - but were placated instead by the photographs on the wall and then the menu items.  Our waiter was EXCELLENT, very friendly and extremely knowledgeable and patient with all of our questions.  My 16 year old ordered the peppercorn stead and mashed potatoes.  My 14 year old ordered king crab legs and mashed potatoes.  Both - who are big mashed potato eaters - said they did like the potatoes.  Both complained that they were too lumpy and not hot enough.  Younger said his crab legs were a little rubbery.  I had the Caesar salad.  The dressing was not \"anchovy\" enough for me; and, although I opted for the addition of the actual anchovy fillets, I was underwhelmed.  Younger ordered dessert - ice cream with chocolate and caramel sauces in a almond brittle \"cup\" - and that was delicious.  : )  Overall, we had a great night and fun visit and meal with our relative.  Elder rated the overall experience a 4 out of 5 and Younger a 4.5 out of 5.  Would definitely go back to MG with any other out-of-town guest who also desired the same Seattle experience but might not choose MG as the next birthday restaurant; although, the nine layer chocolate cake might be worth the trip . . .",

While a good steward/sommelier should be efficient in their selections, I felt that he was not taking the time to understand our tastes and goals for our wine. It was clear from his vague descriptions that he had never tried the wine that he pushed us toward. For the money (or much less), there are other better quality steak houses, with more personalized service.\n\nOn the plus side, our server was very friendly and attentive. The steaks also come with sides, as opposed to making you buy them \u00e0 la cart like other places. The Met also graciously provided a free dessert to celebrate our anniversary.",

Don't get me wrong it wasn't awful, but when you factor in the price to eat at this place, there was nothing special about the food, service or atmosphere (way to loud).  We ordered the filet's and both came out undercooked based on what we told the wait staff.  My husband knew more about wine then their Sommelier which is another disappointing feature about the place.  When your bill is over $400.00 you want to leave feeling like it was worth it not disappointed and thinking you paid based on their reputation and nothing else.  I would NOT go back even if it was free!!",

        "Content": "Ambience\nCame here hoping for a romantic evening, had mentioned on our reservation that my girlfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary, but overall, was left wishing for more. First off, we were sat about two tables from the entrance. It was a particularly energetic night, probably because the Seahawks had just lost a game at home, but even so, it was a high traffic location and didn't seem appropriate at all. \n\nService\nI also felt put off by the dress of the service staff. There were quite a few that were wearing what seemed to be lab coats. Not sure if that is standard steak house attire, but it made the place seem sterile and cold. The lamp on the table helped some. \n\nFood\nAs for the food, we had their French onion soup. Delicious, light broth. Served hot and crispy cheese. A little too much cheese for me, but you can never complain for having too much. \n\nFor the steak, we started off by asking the waiter for his recommendation. He was very unclear about which cuts were good and never asked us more clarifying questions about what we liked. In the end, we wanted to try a seasonal item, so we went with the Snake River Farms top cap sirloin. The server recommended medium rare so that was our temperature. \n\nSteak was very generously sized, and our server took it upon himself to cut the steak into small pieces for us. Personally, I would have liked for him to ask, as I enjoy attacking a large piece of meat on my own. Steak was rare. As in I took a piece and touched it with my lip, and the center was cold (not warm for a medium rare). I thought it was interesting and continued eating my steak, but my girlfriend had to send hers back for more time in the oven. Too bad. We ended up taking quite a portion of steak home and cooked it more then next day.\n\nOverall\nI wish the server would have asked us more questions and tailored our experience a little better. If their medium rare involves a cold center, that would have been nice to know.",

This past Thursday (8/21) I went for a second-year anniversary dinner and was blown away. The ambience is warm and inviting; we had a server that was very personable and funny. I had the combination Wagyu filet and Prime filet. My fork just glided through the Wagyu and the Prime had an intensely meaty flavor. Ultimately, this was one of the most fantastic dining experiences I've ever had. It was unquestionably the best steak my boyfriend or I had ever had, or perhaps will ever have.",

Their cooking scale is wrong. But even worse. The steaks were utterly dry. I think they had been frozen. The baked potatoes were great, but that didnt make it upmfor these extremely overpriced medium quality steaks!\n\nThe wine list is ridiculuously expensive. They multiply with at least 5.

We had their salmon (I know, no steak at a steakhouse!) and it was the best we'd had - cooked perfectly. Loaded baked potato on one and their tasty roasted root vegetables on the other. The only item that was a little off was the Ceasar - good but not as flavorful as we'd remembered. The waiter was great - stopped by just at the right moments and the sommelier was very knowledgeable and shared his knowledge on the local Washington wine. Will definitely return the next time we are in town.",

I was very dissapointed and especially for the money we spent I expected so much more. Our favorite steak house has always been Jaks on California ave. It still is.

The last few times I have dined here we like to arrive a little early and have a drink in the bar.  Very difficult to get the waiters (or anyone in the bar) to pay attention to us.  I usually end up ordering from the bartender by crowding up to the already full bar.  Then, as soon as the drinks come, the waiter appears.  They could improve the service here.\n\nDinner was great!

Still I spent over $200 for two. It all adds up quick. The place is a little crowded too and noise level is more than the norm. The Met is not a romantic place for that reason.",

We have requested medium rare and it came a bit on the rare side and the meat around the bone was nearly dripping in blood. We told the server it is a bit rare. And he said as long as the center is cooked to medium rare it is fine. I don't understand what that meant. I thought the whole steak should be done to perfection considering this restaurant is famous for their steak. And I had the steak done to perfection even the bone area at this restaurant before! Their dessert is to die for. So far we have tried their chocolate cake, coconut cake and carrot cake. The portion is big.",

It had little to no flavor, though it was cooked to my liking. The potatoes served with it were lukewarm. The cake we had for dessert was freezer burner (white choc chip coconut cake). And the mashed potatoes, though delicious, were excessively salty.\n\nThe salad we had was amazing. But all of the above wasn't worth nearly $60 a person. I won't be coming back, Met. Sorry!",

The only negative was being over ruled on the asparagus w/B\u00e9arnaise instead we had the Brussel Sprouts which I found to be slightly undercooked and the sprouts were a bit chewy.

Not sure if this was a one time thing, but we might stick with Daniels just because the service/food is better.",

Not as good as it smells from the outside. When walking past the Met the smell of grilled steaks is (to say the least) mouthwatering. When a restaurant charges upwards of $60 for a ribeye steak and there is so little flavor in the meat, it is outrageously overpriced. Yes, the steaks were tender and wonderfully cooked, but tasteless. Dry.\n\nGrossly overpriced. Ophelias (Sarasota, FL) & Slanted Door (SF, CA) are much better value.",

When it came the chef had taken it upon himself to slice it up for me, like I was a little kid without a steak knife. The meat wasn't as soft as other top end steaks I've had and was a little disapointing. Black and Blue in Vancouver B.C. and Aqua by El Gaucho are two that I would recommend over these guys. They just didn't seem very people orientated. Bill and the end was $150, about what I excpected to pay for a high end steak house, but it was worth $90.",

This place is 3 for 3 with us and has yet to disappoint. Highly recommended.",

The sides were also delicious - they do a brussels sprout dish with bacon and small onions that is wonderful.

In fact we probably won't be back. Not because they did anything wrong but simply because my 8oz filet was $56, and if it would have been spectacular it would have been worth it, but because it was just nice it wasn't. I can think of a dozen other restaurants where I can get a filet for $20 less than at The Met which is more tender and has better flavor.

It's a shame. We want to like it, but it doesn't deserve to be liked recently.",

I'm impressed when a restaurant does what I can't do myself - but my own crab cakes blow these away. The salmon I grilled in the backyard was better and the check lightened my wallet by two weeks groceries. The wine list is 3 digits with many 4 digit prices... many of these are at Costco for under $100. With all of the options for dining in Seattle, I can't see why anyone would spend this kind of money for such mediocrity.

We appreciated the honesty. However, he didn't offer a replacement with any other side or offer to give us a small break on one of our other dishes. We ordered a side of asparagus with b\u00e9arnaise (delicious!), glasses of wine and coffee and dessert (also delicious!). Plenty of chances to make the one off thing right.

The restaurant itself was extremely busy which made for a good ambience but it felt a little too loud and manic for my taste.

We were going to have the Prime New York but were talked into have the Wagyu steak. We were expecting a lot from this steak - disappointed. The steak was underseasoned, tougher than expected, flavorless and flat. The roasted root vegetables were very good. The Brussell Sprouts were a bit undercooked too.

We moved to Washington 7 years ago, and this was our first time at the Met. The out-of-town guests who joined us for dinner can't wait to tell all their airline friends about the food, drink, atmosphere, etc. of this great Seattle establishment.

The Prime cuts were just like all the others I've had at various steakhouses in Seattle, Chicago, New York, etc., etc. The frites with the steak were exceptionally good. The wine list was extensive with good selections from Bordeaux, Burgundy, Napa, Sonoma, Oregon, and Washington, with smaller selections from a variety of other wine regions. The service was very good, but not outstanding (too many times we were left waiting for the waiter to come back).",

I had the top cap steak (split with my wife - the portions are large and I can't eat 18oz of meat alone) with steak fries and brussels sprouts (very good), and others at my table had the scallop appetizer for dinner with asparagus, a special consisting of two small filets with blue cheese (side of macaroni and cheese), and a larger ribeye. The fries were a lark, I do not recommend, but everything else was very good - the flavor of the top cap was excellent. The Metropolitan Grill selected wine is a good deal by the bottle.

The outside was hot and juicy, while the interior was solid and flavorful.\n\nThe service was excellent, too. Out server gave us the ins and outs on the different cuts of meats, yet never pushed us toward the more expensive cuts, something I was most appreciative of. Also, the wine list was extensive and their classic cocktails were very good, I recommend the mint julep.",

My wife's New York steak was excellent, but my filet was fantastic. The creme brulee was excellent.\n\nAmbiance was nice. Dark wood paneling and moderate lighting creates a more intimate feel, although space is fairly open, so I stop just short of calling the setting romantic. Our seats were very comfortable. Service was very good. All in all, we had a nice evening at the Met and would recommend it.",

We were told by one of our servers that we sat @ the same booth used by Pres. Bill Clinton. No joke! . If it's of interest to ya, there were lots of framed pictures of movie stars, athletes, politicians and other notable celebrities on the walls all over the restaurant. The food was what you'd expect from a fine steakhouse. I had the prime rib with garlic mashed potatoes and my husband had bacon wrapped fillet and steak house fries. Both our meats were perfectly cooked as we requested (his rare, mine medium). One negative is that my mashed potatoes was too salty.",

Both were cooked to perfection and were mouth watering good, We also had oysters for the appetizer, and they fell short of expectation. They were small and there were only 6 of them. For $20.00 it seemed they should have been better. As for the service, the waitress was informative but seemed a little rushed and preoccupied. She was nice, but for the prices that your paying, you might expect a little more attention to detail from your server. In closing, go for the steaks, not the service.",

Some collegues of mine went last month and we all ordered the bone-in filet based on how fabulous it was the time before. Sadly, it was not the same. The steaks were smaller and had a considerable amount of fat, way too much for a filet. It was more like a ribeye. Our server knew we weren't satisfied, but offered nothing to make it up. I went again recently, got the lg prime filet, and it was just ok. The Met\u2019s mission is to always \u201cexceed your expectations\u201d but recently, mine were not exceeded or met.",

The service was accommodating and terrific. I probably won't be going back. I'd much rather have a great steak at El Gaucho -- where the steaks are way better, in my opinion.

The ambiance does not compare with that of Ruth's Chris. Too much noise, no low lighting. We go to Seattle often, and when there again we will have dinner elsewhere. There is a Ruth's Chris at Pine and 8th, that is where we will dine. This was an overall disappointment as we met family members there, whom we have not seen for many years.

Ordered a 1/2 bottle of wine, the sommelier brought it, but said it had gone bad and brought a recommended replacement. We had the Prime Filet and American Wagyu Filet; did not notice that the Wagyu was significantly better than the Prime, both were excellent. The side of sauteed spinach was overly salty, but tasty.",

The Chicago Cut steak was pretty grissly and I had to fight through quite a bit of sinew and fat to eat it. The service was great as usual and the side dishes were great. But after spending over $50 per Waygu steak we expect them to be done perfectly and have prime-level marbling and flavor.",

The Met tries to match the quality of the best New York steak houses but consistently does not quite make it. I keep thinking about why. For me it comes down the steak not being quite as hot and flavorful, the side relatively uninspiring and the service slightly over relaxed and inattentive. Expect I will be back but still wishing for that 10 - 15% more out of the experience.",

I am actually not a meat eater (the ahi was fantastic, unusual in a steakhouse setting, as were the seafood apps), but I chose this for my husband's 50th and it was a perfect choice.

So my birthday gift to him was the $99 50 oz. Long Bone and he was ecstatic! Great steak, lots of flavor. I wish I had ordered the 36 oz. Long Bone instead of the filet as the taste was just superb. I highly recommend it for you steak lovers. My family will go back in the future and order it for 4-5 of us to share. Great service. It is a bit noisy, but what is a steakhouse without activity.",

My daughter had the pork chops, you get 2 huge chops, about 2 inches thick, perfectly prepared. We split creme broulle, they call it burnt creme. Unbelievably rich egg and cream mixture, the crispy carmelized sugar top was a treat to break through, exploding with flavor and texture. Outstanding.

The service is great: helpful but not intrusive. No hovering, but right there if you need it. Then why the only \"good\" rating? First off--it's waaaay too expensive. With your steak (cheapest at $50 and rising way up) you get a baked potato. Well, yes that potato has gobs of butter, cheese sauce, sour cream and scallions--but no bacon. They used to have non-stop bacon. And for $9 more we ordered the Caesar salad. Honestly, I've had a salad as good from a bag from the grocery store. IMO a restaurant that aspires to top level needs to be top level all the way. No disappointments allowed.",

My steak was cooked perfectly and tasted really good but I certainly didn't feel I got value for money.\n\nMy wife ordered the vegetarian option (Grilled Portobello Mignon) at $20 which seems like a bargain next to a menu of $70 steaks but is also over priced if you break it down to mushrooms, mash, asparagus, onions and sauce.\n\nService was outstanding, can't fault anything there.

The service is always top-notch and if something is not correct, they seem to sense it and make it right. The food is very good and there has not been anything wrong with it all the times I have been. It is pricy though, which is why we don't go alot. But they do have a wonderful once a year deal, the Have Dinner on Us. Go once, and they take the amount of two entrees and give you a certificate worth the amount for the next time. Great deal! This is a great place to take visitors to Seattle.Highly recommend!",

Although the steak was cooked to perfection at medium, the side dish of fat and the connective tissue that came of the steak was a bit much.

On the other hand, wait staff excel at their craft and the crab cocktail was outstanding - best I've ever had. Lobster tail was good but undercooked. The filet mignon sampler(two types of beef) was very good but not outstanding as expected (although cooked exactly to order). Chocolate decadence dessert was good, not great. Overall, very enjoyable.

Good salads, but when the beef arrived the wheels came completely off. One of the steaks was so full of gristle it could even be cut, then it took at least 30 minutes for a replacement steak to arrive after it was sent back.

My peppercorn NY was well-seasoned, but didn't have quite as much peppery kick to it as in the past. My husband's prime filet was fabulous as always. His onion soup was good, as was my blue cheese wedge salad. We skipped appetizers in favor of saving room for dessert, burnt creme (always good) for me and a chocolate sundae for my husband.

I took my 17 year old daughter for her first visit so she may enjoy the very high level of service and quality dining. Although the service was adequate and we both thought our waiter was fun and engaging, I was a little let down. It simply wasn't the high level of service I'd expect when spending over $200 for dinner. I noticed it because I've had more experiences with this however my daughter didn't. I'll quote her \"Dad I feel like I'm in the Hello Dolly movie\".\nOn the plus side, the food was just as fantastic as I ever had! You can not go wrong with a steak at the Met! I still recommend you go there!",

The steaks are good, but not that good. The front desk staff was good, but we waited twenty minutes for our table past reservation time. Water was poured and we sat fifteen minutes with no one else coming to the table. Only when I went to ask the front if we actually had a waiter did anyone appear, and he seemed put out that we had summoned him. It is a wonderful restaurant normally and it is fine for a special occasion, but it is now relegted to that status for me because of it's prices.",

This huge side of cow shoed up at our table and was carved infront of us. Perfectly cooked (but not a lot of seasoning). They offered a white sauce (creamy good) for dipping and cheddar/beer sauce for over the potatoes. Was all good. Finished the night off with the chocolate/carmel lava cake. Was really good.

Very attentive, but not TOO much and a very nice sense of humor. A wonderful part was the dinner was the fact that we could hear each other talk!

We amused ourselves by watching a busboy pour wine into a potted plant while waiting for our check which we had to ask the busboy for.

Our table was not ready at the time of our reservation & we were kept waiting for a good 15-20 minutes with hardly a word & definitely no apology when we were seated. I suspect they were hoping we would ask to sit in the bar so they could sell us more drinks. Fortunately, the service improved significantly when we finally were seated. The food for the most part was excellent, although the $9.00 sauteed mushrooms were pretty obviously from a can.\n\nCertainly not the worst meal we've had, but there are lots of other better places in Seattle that we'd rather dine at.",

The steak had a little more fat that I am used to for a steak that price, but maybe that was because I ordered the Wagyu instead of Prime. Booth was a little snug, but was not unpleasant. Steak comes with Potato which is not usually done at high end steak joints, I appreciated that because it enabled you to also order some of the side items you may not order in favor of the spuds usually. Steak was seasoned and seared to acceptable standards for the a price. I definately recommend The Met if you have already been to Daniels, otherwise, I say Daniels edges it out slightly due to quality of meat and atmosphere (SLU location).",

Last time I went I ordered a strip steak with apples and mushrooms in a bourbon sauce. The steak was, as always, fabulous, but the apples and mushrooms (which I had wanted for variation in taste and texture) were overcooked (read bland and mushy). This same thing happened at an earlier visit when I had ordered a pork chop with apples. At this point, I'll just stick with ungarnished red meat. Servers are hit or miss",

The lobster bisque was good, I prefer Nordstrom Grille's or Duke's - I like it with more chunky bits of goodness. The noise level was quite loud as it was a busy and bustling evening.

At this price level, I expect the steaks to be outstanding. The calamari appetizer, a tiny portion, consisted of fishy tasting bits of tentacles on a very large pile of chopped tomato. The \"signature\" flourless chocolate torte was a huge disappointment which had been stored in the chill box too long. The microwaving of it produced a unacceptable result with hot spots next to cold spots, and bits of sugar which had recrystallized. I am happy to pay $350 for 3 people, but I expect an exceptional dining experience. This week, Metropolitan Grill failed miserably.",

Other than the fact that we waited a little too long between the first course and our main course, service was great and it was worth the wait...everyone's steak was cooked just as ordered and delicious. I ordered the special - just-caught Copper Salmon - and it was to die for, especially with the yummy mashed potatoes and asparagus. We had a corner booth and it was very cozy and quiet. I like that they offer half bottles of wine as we were there on a Sunday night and my husband and I didn't want to drink a whole bottle, but wanted more than one glass. I've heard a lot about this restaurant and it did not dissapoint!",

Food was pretty much what you would expect at a steakhouse in this price range. Almond crusted scallop appetizer was great as was the wine. Steak was very good. My medium rare came out slightly overdone and my wife's medium well came out underdone. But they were close enough and tasted good. They do seem to focus a bit more on seasoning the steaks than I am used to at this kind of steak house but the seasoning was good and did not diistract from the quality of the meat",

The size of the steaks was a bit daunting but I settled on a 14 oz New York and my parents had prime rib and salmon. All was pronounced very good.

No complaints there.\n\nHowever, no seasoning is applied to the meat so I had to put salt & pepper on my own steak.\n\nTheir Steak is supposed to be grilled with imported Hickory Wood, however there were no grill marks on their steaks. I like to see grill marks on my steak.\n\nBasically, overall, very good food....overpriced meat.",

I haven't had a opportunity to try Japanese Wagyu and getting to compare with American Wagyu on the same plate....genius.

I had the combination 4oz. American and 4oz. Japanese Wagyu filets. My significant other had the Ohmi Tenderloin. We were blown away. The meat was so tender it melted in your mouth. The American and Japanese Wagyu steaks were both very tasty. We also got the crab mac & cheese, which was good but, tasted a little like processed cheese. The asparagus with Bearnaise sauce was delicious. And for desert get the 9-layer chocolate cake, can feed 3 people easily! Very good experience here. I would come back every week if it wasn't so expensive. But it was worth it.",

Maybe I don't get out to nice places enough, but this was by far my best dinner experience. The Met is known for it's great steak, but don't let that stop you from ordering their other entrees. My wife had a fettuccine dish with crab claw that was absolutely delish! Everything from the salad, side dish,drinks, to the entrees was perfect. Too bad we cheated ourselves by not leaving room for desert. Of course no dining experience can truly be enjoyed without good service. No problem here, it was our server Bruno who made our experience unforgettable. The Met is pricey but well worth every cent. I look forward to bringing my wife here for our 20th.",

The service was very informative and attentive to our needs. Our final bill came to $225 with tip so in this respect I thought it was overly pricey compared to some of the other \"best\" steakhouses in the area. We only go to these \"fancy\" restuarants once a year on his birthday and the total experience was in the top 2. I highly recommend the 9 layer chocolate cake if you are a chocolate lover - easily the best chocolate cake I have ever had in my life, sorry Mom. One last tip, try to not get a table by the front door as on cold nights you can feel the draft every time the door gets opened. Bon Apetite!",

Very down to earth and fun.\nBefore dinner - we did have a drink at the bar. One of the bartenders made us a special \"taster\" to try (for free) so that was nice. But i was still dissapointed with my steak. I'd had better steak at a place like Texas Roadhouse..unfortunatly.",

The other chose a NY Strip $48 which was promoted as coming from the American version of Kobe beef. It was just awful. It was prepared perfectly, but the steak itself was more gristle and hunks of fat than I have ever seen on a NY Strip. At least 1/3 of the steak was inedible. The baked potato was the best part of the main course. This is an expensive restaurant with disappointing food.",

His knowledge of the menu and wine list was complete. He didn't push recommendations but was ready with them when asked. He also up-sold items that he thought we might enjoy and were appropriate to the selected entree'. Michael did not hover but seemed to magically appear when needed. He is good.\n\nWe selected Rib Eyes and the bone-in fillets...Served quickly, sizzling, extremely Flavorful and cut like butter. Portions & presentation were perfec",

You can easily share any meal on the menu, and if you are on a budget, I would suggest doing just that.\n\nThe waiter was great, there when you needed him yet amazingly unobtrusive.\n\nThe price of coffee was a bit high for my taste, and was incredibly strong, not for the feint of heart or of taste buds.",
