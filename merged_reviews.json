We stared off with and appetizer that Anthony Bourdain inspired us to try and now never pass up when available: roasted bone marrow on crostini with hazelnut romesco sauce and brilliantly accented with pickled shallots. My wife had the house field green salad; nicely balanced flavors, and I had the sublime Maine Lobster Bisque and fought to restrain myself from simply drinking from the soup tureen. My wife had the most amazing steak dinner of her life: a small but intensely delicious 4 oz Japanese A5 Snow Beef Filet.  I enjoyed a chef's menu choice 14 oz bourbon aged striploin.  Both medium rare (of course!) and served in complement with simply perfect starch sides for us - the mashed potatoes & the baked potato with all the classic toppings.  We had never done a flambeed tableside desert, and seeing the description of the Hot Apple Pie we knew this was the place to try it.  Needless to say we were not disappointed.  Both the performance and the resulting desert for two were fantastic.  No matter what else you may choose for the rest of your meal, we highly suggest ending with the Hot Apple Pie!\n\nThe staff was polite and attentive from reservation check in & coat check at the host station all through out the meal courses and flambeed tableside desert, paying the bill and coat check out.  It was relatively early on a Saturday before a performance at the Paramount and the general manager also stopped by to ask how our meal was.  \n\nMy wife and I look forward to dining at The Metropolitan Grill again.  Our 26th wedding anniversary is in June.  You can be sure I'll be marking my calendar in May to get a reservation as soon as they're available.",

It was a weekday and was not very busy so was not happy about the service.

Always had a great meal and service until this last visit. We ordered two medium rare Chateaubriand's for the five of us at $180 per piece. I was shocked when they came out as medium well. The ma\u00eetre de knew very well when he started carving the meat that they were not cooked to order yet he kept on carving rather than send it back to the kitchen and ordered two new ones. To offer us dessert on the house to make up for their kitchen's mistake is insulting and not a very good way to compensate for a bad meal. We did not come for the dessert, we came because of it's reputation as top steak house. I called in the next day to the restaurant to talk to management and received a call back the next day. Although the manager was congenial enough and listened to my feedback, his solution to compensate me was to throw out a few free appetizers for the next time in. After this experience, there will not be a next time. In all honesty, the two cuts of meat should have been compted. I have no problem paying for the cocktails, wine and appetizers that we enjoyed with our food but do not feel it fair that we ended up with two tasteless and very expensive cuts of meat.

Their food has always been excellent.  The steaks are always cooked at a perfect temperature and the flavors are always spot on.   \nBut in this new era of restaurants thinking they can make up wage increases by implementing a service charge the metropolitan grill has won the prize for over compensating.  To my surprise when the bill came and Aaron explained to me that there was a 20% service charge I just about lost it.  Because the service charge wasn't even going to Aaron and Scott, it was for the company's profit to pay their employees above average benifits and supposedly year end bonus.  And if we wanted to tip our server they would receive all of it, well good for MG to be so generous.  This will be the last time i dine here and i will be reposting this review on every site i can, so that futre patrons are aware of this ridiculous 20% robbery.",

My only gripe is that I do wish there was less confusion regarding the 20% service charge many establishments in the Seattle area (including this one) have put in place to offset an increased minimum wage. Does any of that charge go to the service staff beyond their base compensation- or should I be forking out an additional percentage? It puts a sour note on the tail end of an otherwise lovely evening when you\u2019re sitting with a bill wondering whether declining to pay 30 to 40% over your bill is effectively stiffing someone who just spent an hour and a half waiting on your needs.

I have to say that was the worst piece of meat I have ever received here. I was very disappointed, and there was no way it was Prime grade. It was tough with big fat deposits. I couldn\u2019t see any marbling in this steak. Plus I asked for rare to medium rare, but was served medium well done. Still had a great night and hope next experience is better.",

We ordered a 40 oz bone in rib eye, and it was cooked very nicely just the way we asked for it, which was between medium and medium rare, if you get what I mean. We also got to watch it cut right in front of us by a very skillful staff member. Portions are great for the price you are paying and everything about this place is just wonderful.

Our bill should be take out $145 for the promotion , but the waitress Julie said: because we also ordered the Fettuccine , so she can only deducted $72.50 from our bill. We don\u2019t think that is correct but no manager can be talked to ! Also need we need to pay 20% service charge for such soso customer service! Not worth to go to Metropolitan Grill again \uff01our bill should be $110 less !",

I have been a prior very happy customer of the Metropolitan Grill and told my wife when we visited Seattle on Monday we must stop their for lunch with our son and girlfriend, who works in Seattle and is a very frequent guest at the Metropolitan Grill.\nMy wife ordered the Filet Mignon Medium Well.  First it arrived Medium Rare, but that really wasn't the issue.   The piece of meat was inedible and had so much grizzle in it that I had trouble cutting it with my knife. I had the Top Sirloin and it was fine and actually much more tender than the filet!\n\nUnfortunately it was a $268 lunch that was a bust.",

Unfortunately this time didn't compare to our past visits.  Our table was cramped for a party of 4 and I feel we should have been seated in a booth. Our server was on par; however, the sommelier didn't appear to really know the wine list and had a very hard time making recommendations. For the 3rd time in my life I sent my meal back. The prime rib was tough and cold in addition to the potatoes. Two others in our party had the Wagu and American filets which were lukewarm and not very flavorful. The other meal consisted of the bone-in rib steak which was hot and very good. Our server did see to it that we were comp'd for the prime rib which was a solid thing to do. Bottom line: If I'm going to spend in excess of $500 for a meal I expect it to be nothing short of spectacular. This trip to MG resulted in me feeling as though I paid prime prices for a sub-par meal. It's doubtful we will be back.",

All food was delivered by someone other than my waiter. Also I received my meal but then had to ask for wine to go with it even though I expressed desire for wine with the meal earlier in the evening. I had already started eating before I was able to request it. I believe that the service is now driven by other factors. First I was asked how often I come there. Which isn't that often so perhaps my not being a regular mattered. Second, my party wasn't big enough or drink enough to make it worth their while to put in the time. It definitely was not worth the money. Very disappointed since it wasn't like it has been in the past. Guess I will start looking for another favorite restaurant in Seattle.",

Additionally, according to the manager I spoke with, the servers are now being paid commission (I\u2019m ok with that) at a rate of 13%.  When the server brought us the check she pointed out the new service charge  but omitted the fact that she was on commission.  So, in fact, with a 20% tip and 13% commission she would have made banked a pretty robust tip.  I\u2019m all for tipping according to service received. But there\u2019s some smoke and mirrors here that most people are not throwing a fit over. I did, and got the service charge removed. My meal was ~really~ $250 (see attached receipt.)  The 20% \u201cservice charge\u201d ($50) + a 20% tip on the entirety of the check ($65) would have totaled $105 on $250 check. This is a BAD practice and I will not return.

We each had a bowl of soup (clam chowder for him and French onion for me!), then shared the Chateaubriand, and the apple \"pie\" for dessert. Everything was amazing, about the experience from the time we arrived (about 30 minutes prior to our 7:30pm reservation, but they were able to accommodate immediate seating) until the time we walked out the door. I highly suggest ordering anything prepared tableside, as you'll get to have a great conversation as your food is being prepared. Our server, Lance, was prompt and professional and the combined team created an exceptional experience. \n\nWhile I gave The Met 4 stars for \"Value\", you don't really go there for a \"value\" meal - you go there for the experience that only fine dining gives you.",

However this last time there were a couple of issues that need to be highlighted. We were a party of 5 and ordered 5 different steaks,  I tasted them all and they were all excellent,45 day rib-eye, Waygu-Angus NY, NY and Filet, no complaints on the steaks or their preparation. The same can't be said for the sides. The garlic mashed potatoes were super dry and cakey, I don't recall them being like this in the past. Also the cauliflower side was mediocre, the preparation with almonds and feta is promising but the execution was off, the florets could have been better caramelized to add to the complexity of the dish. It also seemed like something was missing to bring it all together. The Brussels sprouts were also disappointing, again the preparation held promise but the execution lacked. I recall some roasted caramelized sprouts that i had a scout restaurant several years ago. They were simply amazing, like vegetable candy, so i know the lowly Brussels sprout can achieve greatness. That is what i would expect from a restaurant of the Met's caliber. The met prepares truly memorable steaks but the need to up their game on the sides. Also it is a bit noisy for my taste, call it energetic if you will but it makes conversation difficult.",

We had predetermined that we wanted to try the chateaubriand, substituting creamed spinach and Yukon Gold potato cakes as sides. Our waiter, Bruno, who was outstanding,  suggested the almond-crusted scallops as an appetizer. The scallops were the best we've ever tasted, and the chateaubriand, carved tableside, was memorable. The sides were just OK. The ambiance was friendly and fairly elegant, and the noise level, though not whisper-quiet, was fine for normal conversation. I had two glasses of The Devil You Don't Know syrah (also Bruno's suggestion) and my wife had one. We shared the Hot Apple Pie for dessert. We hadn't paid close attention to the prices, so we were a little surprised that the $250 didn't quite cover the meal and gratuity, but we'll definitely return for a special meal in the near future.",

The service was perfect - our server was intuitive to our needs without being intrusive to our meal. The food itself was amazing; we had the crab cakes and artichoke hearts and both were delicious. For our main course we ordered the chateaubriand which is prepared tableside and that was incredible to watch. It was the most perfectly cooked filet I've ever had - absolutely worth the price in my opinion. The sides were ok - nothing special (mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts). We ordered cr\u00e8me brulee for dessert and it was very good, again not anything overly special but it was very good and we ate it all. Their wine list is extremely impressive - we enjoyed a nice Syrah and a Cab blend - both were by the glass and were VERY good. I was surprised by how loud the restaurant was - when we arrived and were seated there were maybe 3 other tables occupied in the section, however, by the end of our meal every table to was full and it was very loud. We could have conversation in our booth but I can't imagine being seated at a center table - that was the ONLY downside to the entire evening but because it wasn't really crowded until towards the end of our meal I can't really count that as a negative for our visit. If you are wanting a more intimate/quiet experience, come earlier than 7pm. We loved the experience overall and we will definitely be back for a special occasion.",

The feel and decor for the restaurant are classic and classy. Gives you a good feeling to the place. Service from the staff as a whole wasn\u2019t horrible but wasn\u2019t on par from other steakhouses. Food was average and wine was over priced and not very well advised on.\nWe were greeted checked in pleasantly, however my wife felt she was getting stares from certain staff members when she pushed by our 2 year old in her stroller. The person who took us to our booth seamed a bit unfriendly but didn\u2019t upset our mood. Our waiter was nice and did take our drink order almost right away. My lobster bisque was average with no lobster bits or chunks like others I have had, my wife\u2019s French onion was great however. I ordered the \u201csnow beef\u201d because I have had all other cuts of beef on the menu at other places, my wife the SRF filet. I felt my steak was ok, not impressive but nothing bad. The filet was as expected from SRF, delicious. We wanted a bottle of wine and asked for an opinion from their solminer but didn\u2019t suggest or give us a better recommendation. The wine had little to no character. We also didn\u2019t get checked on or asked about our meal or liking of our meat. Rather strange for and steakhouse. \nGiven it\u2019s price I wanted to love the food especially if it would have met my expectations.

We ordered a second dish and he said he was going to check of that was still available but never returned with the answer. \nWhen we finally ordered, he was not very polite when responding to our questions about the side.\nLastly, at the end of our meal, I asked for a box to take home the leftover sides I had (no meat was left). He used a very rude tone and asked \u201care you taking this???\u201d.

We weren't able to imbibe as we were still on the clock, but the virgin bloody mary was tasty and spicy. My co-worker and I both ordered the Monday special of London Broil, which is a bargain at $16. Unfortunately, my slice was very stringy and tough, which was surprising given the outstanding steaks I have had in the past at the Met. We were pressed for time to get back to work so I didn't send it back. The service was very good, we let the server know we were pressed for time and he did a terrific job of timing our meal and wrapping us up quickly. We did get dessert to go and that evening my husband, daughter and I each enjoyed a generous slice of carrot cake from the single serving that I took home!  I am a big fan of The Met and won't let this one fluke change that opinion.",

We have never been disappointed, though this last visit, we were somewhat surprised to see our filet mignon steaks looking like a typical flat sirloin and not the rounder taller filet we had been accustomed to.  It was also not the \"melt-in-your-mouth\" tenderness we come to expect.  We didn't say anything as the flavor was outstanding, but I would question it if presented with the same next time we dine there.  The chargrilled cauliflower was amazing as were the teriyaki tenderloin bites we had as an appetizer.\nI would highly recommend the Metropolitan Grill to anyone wanting a fine dining experience in a more casual comfortable setting.

I really enjoyed looking at all of the pictures in the lobby of various \u201cfamous\u201d guests who have dined there. The restaurant itself is very loud. I was nervous about being able to hear our own conversation, but luckily we were seated towards the back where it was a bit quieter. The food itself was okay, but not worth the price. I ordered the bacon wrapped tenderloin, which was honestly a very great quality steak. My husband ordered the chicken and it had a thick layer of fat coating it, and it wasn\u2019t very good. We also ordered the caramel bacon and it could have been seared a bit longer. It was also very fatty. I have an egg allergy and had questions about different desert options and I felt as though our server wasn\u2019t the most helpful. I don\u2019t expect anyone to know every ingredient but I thought she could have at least gone to the kitchen to check if a particular desert contained eggs. The restaurant itself is very outdated. The bathroom was pretty gross. Overall I would say the experience wasn't worth the price. Our tab was close to $200 and we could have gotten the same quality at half the price. If the ambience were better maybe I\u2019d go again, but there was just nothing that stood out as exceptional.",

Great location and scene, however when you go to a steakhouse the best dishes should not be the sides or the desserts. Most of our parties\u2019 steaks arrived either incorrectly or unevenly cooked. Additionally, pricing here is 1.25x of any comparable steakhouse in New York City. This restaurant is not a \u201cmust\u201d but will provide a decent meal in a good atmosphere. Good selection of drinks and meats, but ultimately priced too high without justifying the cost with expert preparation.

Service did not get any better from there. I was skeptical when were seated in this room because this is usually the case, but thought I would be optimistic.  The food was good not great ( probably because we were so upset at this point) but honestly the service was so bad it ruined our dinner. The room has absolutely no ambiance because you are isolated from the entire restaurant. That combined with the horrible service made for such a disappointing night. In addition, when the check came the 18% sc was added. Hence the horrible service. Ironically enough, I tip 25 to 30%.

This was my first time at this restaurant and my boyfriend and I had a joint birthday dinner with a few other friends, 6 people in total at our table. We ordered the Seafood Sampler and the selection of seafood was as fresh as it if has just been pulled from the sea. A few people in our group noted the presentation was not as striking as it has been in years past since now the sampler is served on more of a platter instead of a tower.  We also tried the Japanese Tartare which was also excellent, if you enjoy tartare. \n\nMost of the group ordered Wagyu Filet Mignon with various sides, and a bottle of Fidelitas to wash it down.   After polishing off a few drinks and the appetizers, there wasn't much room left for the main course so be sure to bring your appetite. The meat was done perfectly, lightly pink and warm throughout just as the server advised. One person ordered the salmon, which she reported was excellent. if you enjoy potatoes, you must try the roasted poblano scalloped potatoes and you will be in scalloped potato heaven. As an added surprise, our server brought us each a birthday candle lit creme brulee. Creme brulee happens to be my most favorite dessert, and it was out of this world silky, creamy, slightly sweet with the perfect amount of glassy caramelized crunchy burnt sugar on top. Our server was a delight, always right at hand without hovering, and went out of her way to take a picture of our group for us. \n\nIf you are looking to treat yourself and feel like a royalty, or just enjoy an impeccable meal in a relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere, the Met is for you!",

I asked if they had a wine from a vineyard I went to in Bainbridge and if it was available by the glass.  (The vineyard had mentioned that serve the wine there.) They went and got the sommelier and when  he came I explained the wine I was curious about.  Then I mentioned, again,  \"by the glass.\"  He closed the menu, and rudely told me they don't serve that wine by the glass, scoffed to himself and walked away.  I laughed at this because I heard how pretentious this restaurant is and his behavior was so on point. I then had to ask for the tab a few times which led to the paying experience.  They now use hand held devices at the table for you to pay at the table.  But when I went to pay my server was right over my shoulder and when it came to the tip, the screen showed 20% *(which I usually tip anyway) but the server was aggressively telling me to hit \"next\"   on the screen, over and over , so that I could not change the tip and then he took the machine from me and gave himself a 5 star rating?   It was the oddest dining experience I have had to date and the food was not that great either.  The only good thing was the look of the restaurant.  The green velvet booths are nice. This was both my first and last time going to this restaurant.",

The food was absolutely delicious, our server, Ashley, couldn\u2019t have been more accommodating and attentive! We had so many questions, from best cut, cooking temperature, etc., and she took the time to answer every question! She checked in with us periodically, removed glasses as they were emptied and kept wine glasses filled! \nShould I have the good fortune to visit Seattle in the future, I will be visiting the Metropolitan Grill again! \nThank you for a wonderful dinner!",

When I asked if a booth was available and mentioned that I'd requested one when I made the the reservation on Open Table, she said she hadn't seen the request and did take us to a booth instead (the restaurant was not terribly busy). I had also mentioned in the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday. Neither the hostess or the server mentioned it or asked about it. We've been coming to the Met for years, often on birthdays or anniversaries, so I expected a little more personalized attention. We never even got the server's name.

The salad was fresh and crispy and the bread was fresh as well.   \n\nMy steak was not to my liking (well done) and when I returned it to the kitchen, it returned to me under-cooked.  My opinion of the MG sank.  When our server asked how I would like my meat cooked, I stated well done.  He replied, there will be a little pink inside and I totally understood what he was speaking on be cause other locations we have frequented have stated the same.  The difference in those locations and the MG.....the other locations served the meal and the plate was usually hot, which meant the meat was still cooking will on the plate and as I ate, the meat would continue to cook.  My plate was not even warm.  Initially, I am done with a place if I am not pleased.  But while at the MG, we saw another couple we had seen earlier in the day and began talking about Seattle and how they were visiting just as we were and they stated their meal was prepared the way they both desired.  \n\nTherefore, I have concluded when I return to Seattle I will give the MG another try.",

Figured this would be our expensive meal for the trip, even though you cant have a breakfast in Seattle for under $60. The server was great. She explained everything and was very polite and professional with a sense of humor. We ordered three different salads. They were all excellent and the plate was loaded. We then ordered three different meals. My son had what I believed they called the top hat sirloin and a baked potato. It was cooked to perfection he said. He loved it as he should for a $72 steak. I had the peppercorn crusted NY Strip. Though it was cooked the way I liked it it was too fatty for me. So for $64 I wasn't thrilled. My wife had a seafood Alfredo that she said was good but it had mushrooms in it which she didn't realize when ordering. Though a minor setback.  We then split a dessert that was white chocolate and coconut cake which was outstanding. Overall it was good but not sure if we would return on our next trip back. The bill was $300 and honestly we go to Ruth Chris in our state often and we think it is better and a little cheaper.",

This was by far the best meal and dining experience we had all week, and there were other really good ones. Our waiter Bruno, with the distinct baritone voice, was at once engaging and knowledgeable and may be reason enough by himself to return here should we pass this way again! He was truly a pleasure to engage with while making it fun for the girls and informative for us.  And our dessert waiter Craig, who expertly prepared the deconstructed apple pie (a must have) alongside our table was equally delightful. He even followed us outside to take a pic of us with the restaurant as backdrop - a bonus for sure. Both of these gentlemen have worked here over 20 years and, upon playing our family game post-meal describing the experience in 1 word, I chose 'professional', for they truly epitomize the term. And the food? As good as the service was the steaks & potatoes we were served were near the top in taste & quality as any we've had. This is an old-school steakhouse with pricing to match, but well worth it for special occasions, important business liaisons or when you just want a great meal with service to match!",

        "Content": "This was a special meal with our son, daughter and our son\u2019s girlfriend. I asked for a \u2018quiet area\u2019 table and our party of five was seated at a banquet round typically for 8-10. This would have been ok, but the restaurant used the room for a party with two five or so year old girls who ran back and forth throughout the room and neither the parents or the management thought to stop the activity. Mid way through the meal they added a family with a new born to another banquet table in the mix and, fortunately, she or he slept.\n\nService was poorly timed and we had a wait if 30-40 minutes between appetizer course and main entre. My blackened prime rib ordered medium (pink throughout by restaurant definition) was medium well. It was also 1/2 fat. My wife had a regular prime rib and it was almost cold and also not prepared as ordered. Entres were not dropped together which also seemed odd. The bread were a stingy portion and we had to ask for more rather than it being replenished. On a side table were four floral arrangements which could have been placed on the four banquet tables making the evening more festive.\n\nFor $665 we could have easily found a much better meal at a chain steakhouse for 2/3 the cost or less for our party of five. The Met came highly recommended by a former Seattle resident ... unfortunately it appears time has worn on the rep of the Metropolitan Grill. Beware and save yourself some money and have a better experience elsewhere!",

I had made reservations about a week and a half beforehand. The hostess was very nice but everything went downhill from there on. We were a party of 5 and led to a table that sets at least 10. It had an odd flower arrangement on it that looked like it was left over from a shower or something, no big deal though. The service was mediocre at best, took quite a long while for anyone to come over and ask if we wanted drinks and even longer for the drinks to be delivered. Needless to say the prices here are not for the faint of heart which is truly fine if you have an incredible experience. That was not the case. The person who delivered our meals was not the original waitress and had no idea who had what. We were passing plates around until it was straightened out.  I had ordered my stake medium but it was very rare, it was also cold, by the time anyone came by again it was 15 minutes into our meal and too late to send back and since it took so long to get to us anyway I was not about to hold everyone up by sending it back. Bottom line, SO expensive and I have had a better steak at Outback. Think they are trying to cash in on their history as a great steak house in years gone by but trust me this is not the place it used to be.",

The food and service were excellent from the valet to the sommelier.  We had a great meal. Warning, the steaks are cooked to traditional standards; that is, if you ask for med rare, you will get red and warm in the middle. Most folks who want \"medium rare\" really want \"pink\" in the middle, which is \"medium\" here and and at most other first tier steak houses.  My only surprise was a 3% Surcharge added to my bill. The manager, Paul, happened to walk by and when I asked him, he did a very good job of explaining why this was added. With the recent minimum wage in Seattle and the increase in \"hotel and restaurant\" taxes, their choice was to raise prices (already very high with most steaks going for $60+) or to add an automatic 18% gratuity. He explained that a \"tip\" was not a right but given for good service, and also that the tips only went to the wait staff who were already the highest paid employees in the restaurant. Rather than doing that, they added this 3% surcharge which was then divided among all of the employees equally.  That made more sense to me and sounds like a creative and more fair solution. And again, the service from everyone was five star.  I would recommend this place for it's excellent food, unbelievable wine list, excellent service and great atmosphere. Just  be prepared for a high end price for this high end meal.",
